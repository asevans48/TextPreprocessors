course asking much  evidently uaw prefers risk bankruptcy mass layoffs pay cuts
excuse  would union agreed corker 's plan didn ' bush waiting wings bail tarp money
( yup  says person  )
tarp sweeter deal corker 's bill since  one white house source noted  loans come strings attached
thus inefficiencies initial wall street bailout made bailout inefficient
watch  read
two points
one  person going bite bullet release tarp money ( legally )  blame obama
call presser  affirm opposes funding big three without stringent restructuring requirements  humbly declare doesn ' want complicate life incoming administration sinking auto industry knowing support bailout
media 's constantly whining anyway lag time election one 's ascension throne
point frame bridge loan grudging measure necessary orderly transition
two  made point context wall street bailout  let make
anyone gop leadership weighing costs action versus costs inaction running pure dogma
keep thinking person person saying yesterday 'll oppose bailout even though 's impossible know consequences bankruptcy would
hey  mitch
good enough
one 's asking absolute certainty outcome  really impossible ; want good-faith attempt assessing costs  benefits  probabilities courses action
're convinced economic catastrophe inevitable ' want burn taxpayer money trying deflect asteroid  's fine
flip side  think consequences letting big three fail losing million jobs economic climate won ' bad  's fine
good reasons oppose bailout
make case
explain  middle global economic crisis  propping failing industry save jobs least crisis worse option pulling plug
prospect taxed support $ number billion rescue auto industry awful  nearly awful cascade effect consumer purchasing power drying losing job part $ number billion hit economy
're looking something less
sense sides uninterested exploring question  side content repose religious faith divine market arrive least painful solution
least see numbers take communion
really much crisis political leadership financial one
