oops  already happened
's really simple concept  offered $ number mow lawn $ number nothing  would choose
applied general population  many lawns would get mowed
let 's fool  reality live
arguments uninsured americans  uninsured
can not afford
' afford
' make enough money
explicitly pointed earlier  money symbol
real reason ' contribute enough society purchase health care services someone else
therefore  uninsured americans earn insurance  shouldn ' ' earn
end story  ``
uhc plan based argument premise health care system cured taking profit motive system - countries  ``
lot say one
first  can not compare location countries
bigger  divided  diverse  free
's apples oranges
second  taking profit motive accomplishes several things  none cure system
takes motive keep spending
need turn profit  need cut spending  ever
also reduces motive keep consumers happy
happy customers means returning customers means profit
profit means cares customers happy
especially scary case paying whether accept gov insurance (  cost shifted sight taxes  doesn ' disappear ) taking profit motive way guarantees reduced administrative costs
third  uhc based argument premise  clearly stupid idea
good job using ca example
