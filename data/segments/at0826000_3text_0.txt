taking short break politics  weirdest space news 've ever read
enthusiastic amateur space nut since kid  question `` 's `` fascinated many years
serious  scientific paper published astrophysical journal  one respected scientific journals world  astronomers using hubble space telescope saw object far away suddenly appear  mysteriously  disappear right eyes  exactly send astronauts risk life service hubble  paper published last week astrophysical journal  scientists detail discovery new unidentified object middle nowhere
' know  research paper conclusion says `` suggest transient may one new class `` get chill oooh-aaahness spine
especially hundred days observation  disappeared sky explanation
get tinfoil hats  gets even weirder
object also appeared nowhere
wasn '
fact  ' even know exactly located didn ' behave like anything know
apparently  ' closer number light-years far number billion light-years away
's known galaxy either
ruled supernova
's something never encountered
words  ' single clue heck thing
scientists ' discover far away parallax measurement take star visible number days
since brightness object varied  couldn ' use standard measurement either
weird stuff  shape light curve inconsistent microlensing
addition inconsistent known supernova types  matched spectrum sloan digital sky survey database
thing astronomersworking supernova cosmology projectcan tell appeared sudden direction cluster catchy name cl numbernumber+numbernumber  numbernumber billion light-years away
hubble caught spark continued brighten number-day period  peaking numberst magnitude  fade away period time
microlensing would tell scientists object extremely far away  light bent intervening stars galaxies
since object behave like supernova ( exploding star ) ever seen  ruled possibility
something came life  flared  died number days - - less micro second cosmological measurements time
