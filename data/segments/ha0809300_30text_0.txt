yesterday  bush administration declassified released controversial memo person person argued criminal law restrict war-time powers presidency
number analysis sought resolve conflict statutory law constitutional authority granted executive commander-in-chief dealing person enemy combatants held abroad
us also duty uphold un convention torture ( cat ) extent interrogations refrained activities qualified cruel unusual eighth amendment shocks conscience fifth fourteenth amendments
needless say  got quite bit attention years speculation memo 's actual contents well misreporting  effort person person person white location post  first  number memo didn ' authorize start coercive techniques
early september number  congressional leadership parties got briefed interrogations three organization operatives
organization gave members parties dozens classified briefings detailed techniques waterboarding  stress positions  controversial methods congress later acted ban
obviously predates yoo memo
yoo also didn ' occupy position could authorized interrogative techniques
provided legal analysis asked  responsibility relying analysis falls organization  organization  white house
congress certainly appeared agree time frame ; reporting briefings notes none congressional delegation raised objections briefings
one specifically asked whether interrogations made tougher
also  accurate  person didn ' suggest laws treaties ' apply president
gave interpretation apply  made clear point limits congress intrude executive branch exercise duties commander chief
yoo argued laws relating us certainly applied executive related domestic duties ie  president could torture civilians us soil part criminal investigation laws passed congress
however  yoo notes cinc would still bound cat constitution interrogating alien combatants held abroad
reliance standards held fifth  eighth  fourteenth amendments show person envision nearly unfettered presidential power  power bounded treaties constitution
question falls standards mean  whether exclude techniques waterboarding  stress positions  like
'm necessarily agreement memo  especially part iv  lays self-defense argument potential violations limits yoo notes
gets ticking time bomb scenarios person person mentioned debate number bill exception national defense
restrictions techniques force law  law better allow exceptions
otherwise  essentially means president guess whether face prosecution torture  especially results succeed stopping attack
critics later claim danger wasn ' significant enough exception
write laws precisely identify legality illegality acts ' kind ambiguity risk
think congress ability set boundaries war practices without going option constitutional amendment put place  sense  yoo 's analysis seems faulty 's also indefensible
didn ' argue unrestricted exercise power  written period time congress appeared decided techniques question within limits treaties constitutional limits yoo presents
perhaps subtle misc media grasp  much interesting nuanced issue reporting thus far revealed
