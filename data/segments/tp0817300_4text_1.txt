[ person 's ] source year-old senate minority report  turn based misinformation provided department defense
justice scalia 's reliance sources would justifiable urban legend perpetuated ( one would thought ) permanently interred later developments  including number department defense press release hearings house foreign relations committee less two weeks justice scalia 's dissent released
among report 's conclusions  according department defense 's published unpublished data reports  single released guantnamo detainee ever attacked americans
despite national security concerns  department defense system tracking conduct even whereabouts released detainees
little evidence fighters interred location location location  fighters got attacked americans  quite bit evidence  falsely imprisoned many young muslims watching around world  organization politically radicalizing effect
maintaining organization illegal detention sites hurts america 's image abroad  calls question america 's support human rights rule law
good argument closing
