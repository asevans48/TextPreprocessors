woman believes abortion killing babies knives one slick political operator
knows isn ' dialog
knows person vote overturn roe
knows minute roe overturned whole bunch states make illegal
lying
hell necessary woman kansas tell truth cause goals
afraid
born conservative president phone support instead appearing proudly openly pro-life supporters
issue deeply felt morality americans difficulty dealing  ' admit openly want outlaw abortion
know  number percent polled said believe precedent overturned  number percent said believe roe stand
could someone please inform democrats number percent public agrees issue feel confident losing elections issue
pro-life people even state level savvy political con artists pretending powerful lying goals
operating position weakness strength
anybody politics fooled crap fired
people get lot credit honest  good hearted citizens motivated moral compulsion
often conniving liars go great lengths hide real agenda
honest brokers willing hash compromise
insist women allowed abortions  period  babble designed get end  matter
pro-choice advocates ' care never another abortion long individual women choose
pro-choice movement never says women must abortions  use birth control otherwise anything ' choose bodies  including many children bodies bear 's want
`` pro-life `` movement  hand  uses slick public relations techniques agenda forcing women give birth
turn around say pro-choice people absolutists
's maddening
'm getting  tired hearing democrats repeat crap
person person everywhere  issue used bargaining chip  side move goalposts time continue demagogue advocates immoral baby killing
( trouble  person routinely referred advocate `` infanticide `` among people  )
'm sorry people disagree
wish didn '
ball court anti-choicers
refuse accept compromise written law stating abortions ' easily obtained first trimester recently ' obtained second
's compromise real serious one
's enough
fact  nothing enough abortion outlawed
begin war condoms earnest
fact  've already started
sadly  won ' surprised years come see democratic party offer abortion rights `` compromise `` women might keep right birth control
's headed
take pride making chump deals  pretending like profiles courage
( say pretending part know exactly - - - case  clearly want get * icky * issue table
see real commitment philosophical basis except among elected women far outnumbered - - - oh  american people  )
