weirdness wall street continues
world 's greatest fire sale turned something fiasco person person  thought bear stearns wrapped bow fed $ number per share
however  deal started unraveling thanks angry organization shareholders  jpm quintupled offer $ number per share  fed may caused problem
new $ number billion lending facility could used bear stearns reverse bad paper acquired
shareholders bought organization rode high wondering need sell assets number cents dollar
especially object fed 's pushing $ number share price working jpm guarantee $ number billion organization 's worst-performing assets
organization shareholders ask fed simply didn ' offer guarantee organization instead  forced low price deal
answer fed didn ' want seen bailing bear stearns especially management created crisis hasn ' satisfied people holding nearly-worthless organization shares
feel though sacrifice fed 's need save face
irony  course  without deal  shareholders would value
bear stearns would sunk red ink bad paper  instead number cents dollar  value shares would would kindling warm fire winter cabin
structure bailout left obvious question fed acted deus ex machina manner  picking winners losers looks like hefty dollop capriciousness
provide guarantees organization contingent removal board chief executives  instance
problem muscular government intervention markets
even though organization deserved bankruptcy terrible management marketplace  fact government ( auxiliary fed ) determined winners losers makes political rather natural result gross incompetence
problem increased share price makes fed action clearly bailout organization shareholders  fed 's guarantees make higher share price inevitable
