wedding guestby ddayi haven ' done much writing prop
number  though haunts
calitics 've devoted substantial amount time resources  've raised $ number calitics actblue page equality
've praiseworthy campaign times  critical others - think ads fail put face discrimination would actually harm  come vague allow theocons distract distort issue ( `` 'll teach kids gay !
!
! ``
) drive narrative
've happy much progressive movement come together defend attack civil rights  even establishment figures like person person person person gone public cause ( person person allowed campaign use web advertising  's argument made could )
instead analytical post ( short answer every single volunteer vital extremely close vote )  'd like get little personal
today write marry day  hundreds bloggers posting prop
number thoughts gay marriage civil rights
'd like add talking wedding attended months ago
unusual fact extremely casual
morning coffee pastries food drinks set picnic benches park hills behind location  large field wedding held
announcement given ceremony begin  everybody kind meandered field stood around circle
`` aisle `` couple walk created impromptu
eventually got sorted
event might expect - two people loved one another making commitment spend lives together
entirely unremarkable indistinguishable wedding 've invited
except one thing
ceremony conducted assemblymember ( soon state senator ) mark leno
notable authored marriage equality law passed location legislature - twice - vetoed governor person
( remember next time someone tells 's `` practically liberal  ``
's opposing prop
number  supposedly  gone completely silent issue  )
brief remarks  leno talked issue made clear location supreme court rendered decision law
quoted text decision length  particularly portion  organization ruling held location constitution `` forbids creation second-class citizens  ``
state attorney general 's office  argued court state law doesn ' allow gay couples marry  `` failed identify constitutionally adequate reason denying civil marraige same-sex couples  `` person wrote
creation second-class citizens really nub  said leno
defining marriage way  would seek ban gay marriage tell wish love one another
part common experience human condition - desire love another man woman profess commitment
perverse - indeed  irrational human nature - defy love commitment
right marry right share common experience man
served nation world tangible societal benefits promotion family
profoundly conservative virtue
( small-c ) conservative  simple wedding  two people - two men - friends family  coming together express love joy
would pass prop
number would snuff
indeed radicals - kind people would express equality american value
rewrite declaration independence fit worldview  hold truths self-evident  men created equalit 's really simple
thinking attending wedding would maybe write something feelings engendered  wonderful picture basic civil rights expressed
totally unremarkable  waited long
banal  even
two people love one another among hundreds millions even billions planet
nothing special
singled rejected
volunteer number donate cause
's best investment normalcy 'll ever make
