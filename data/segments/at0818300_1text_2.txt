limits thickness arctic ice determined low air temperature get  warm fast-moving subsurface water
air temperatures measured arctic region show recent warming  thus discounting possibility recent thinning ice could caused atmospheric warming ice
rather  thinning ice location clearly associated warming sub-surface ocean  shown scicex data  caused whole part strong location [ north atlantic oscillation - - ocean current change ] increasing flow rate atlantic water arctic ocean
nothing data suggest anything natural cycles work
