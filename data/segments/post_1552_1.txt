' think reason legitimate  say 'll debate
never said people stop fighting rights
said take high road  slower  longer road
take person road  person person person road instead low road may get faster
' take `` us `` road
low road tactic used get faster
recall correctly  compare homosexuals person
said tactics used tactics nazis used
tactic used good
tactic evil
gay movement first use tactic
' like tactic
think calling everyone opposed gay marriage bigot unfair narrow minded
said  `` gays eventually win
right cost  ``
mean  ends justify means
calling people bigot order get way uncalled
've told past voted

'm voting insisting everyone opposed gay marriage bigot even given one reason someone would oppose gay marriage reasons religion chose respond
position implies ends justify means
think better
hard feelings
