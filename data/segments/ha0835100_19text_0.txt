rush limbaugh counts flattered amazed much attention comes way supposedly republican reformers like person person  also little confused
rush wonders person supports big-tent republicanism best conservative talk-show host supported moderate presidential candidate  moderate wants conservatives like rush drummed party
( via person person ) someone supposedly wants promote tolerance  person seems pretty intolerant dissent
let 's make one point  clear  republicans actually nominated moderate candidate  fellow moderates like powell left party anyway
powell want support republican big-tent efforts  need stop going running away big-tenter runs office
gop wants win governing majorities  find ways make message relevant majority
never happen purity purges  ideologically satisfying quick path generation power
rush knew  supported person person general election  supports republicans election time
powell apparently hasn ' learned much politics yet  doesn ' support republicans election time feels enough authority speak party unity
republicans keep powell rush
find ways keep settle core principles unite disparate conservative cliques  person person
choose  however  choice easy
'd rather keep republican
