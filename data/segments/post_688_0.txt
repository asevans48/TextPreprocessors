page=sns note first - brady campaign seeker tighter regulation firearms industry regards safety
outwardly seems like reasonable policy  make safe tools people use safely
one would thing
however  regulations already place  things like transfer bar safeties  drop test requirements  variety safety features included firearms modern manufacture
firearm described brady campaign section  shorter barrel lengths  actually ideal handgun self defense lend actually carried
eliminating guns barrel lengths number eliminates compact auto compact revolver market - driving several gun manufacturers completely business ; despite fact products accurate  safe  useful
'm sure 'm making point clear  pushing elimination junk guns  total elimination style extremely useful defensive gun utilized heavily private citizens

page=awb besides number bans name  parameters ban eliminate number guns well
handguns number oz instance eliminate number excellent hunting pistols ( mine included ) importantly however  ban number guns really aren ' used crimes
original post ways number awb stopped citizens buying guns involved less number % gun related crimes
none easily converted full auto  despite brady campaign say
also put wildly inaccurate information
look assault rifles vs hunting rifles  ' assault rifles meant spray fired hip ' totally made assessment
' assault rifle ' ( part available citizens true assault rifle fully automatic  already dishonest naming ) intended used inaccurate manner
ask military friend happened tried fire mnumber hip
bet drill instructor gave verbal berating wouldn ' soon forget
also - difference hunting rifle assault rifle definition  stock  magazine  ways barrel configuration
readily changeable parts firearm
allows brady campaign ban hunting rifles saying easily converted assault rifles - allowing extend ban eliminate virtually semi-automatic weapons
people talk legitimate sporting purposes want  fact  number military style weapons  rifles handguns  completely safe
limit rights strawman arguments crimes frankly occurred complete disservice citizen
