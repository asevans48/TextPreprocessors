infact makes quite difference
point criminals finding illegal guns like illegal guns  something cant completely erased
saying outlawing would make gun rate increase cause illegal makes logical sense
take place like school  guns  cases shootings happen  much less would people guns everyday
goes biggerscale like usa
also trained lock drill  im certain government would issue something like well
people behind guns `` defending `` trigger happy intruder
say guns aloud criminals  childish need age past barbaric murder caused guns
