fail see different obtaining concealed weapons permit states already
states require background check  require history mental illness ( assuming states couldn ' find statutes number states saying )  must number older  states require type firearms safety course get permit
chance gang members mentally insane getting permit anyways incredibly remote impossible already
adding another layer ridiculous requirements onto something supposed right anyways
also forget wish carry weapon illegally campus matter law says  going get permits aren ' ones need worry
gang members and/or mentally insane wont go requirements carry campus anyways  ' care laws
planning hurting killing someone would care laws saying aren ' allowed carry weapon campus
population numbers must remember ratio concealed weapon permit carriers normal citizens number number
believe campus would safer number/number campus carried propose would never happen
also take account fact number obtain permit takes number % student population equation begin
doesn ' even bring part restricting rights half teachers ( number/number students )
makes different others
also believe teachers deserve rights student body
like said makes number year old first year teacher different deserving right defend number year old veteran coming back school
saying completely bad idea everything stated already done state level repeat
another level government restriction right keep safe
