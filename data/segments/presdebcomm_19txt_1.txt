lehrer  right  next question governor
person person ask
groer  governor person  conflict opposition death penalty support abortion demand  even though minds many people  's also killing
dukakis   ' think
two different issues  've got dealt separately
'm opposed death penalty
think everybody knows
'm also tough violent crime
's one reasons state cut crime industrial state location
's one reasons lowest murder rate industrial state country
's one reasons drug education prevention program reaching helping youngsters state  kind thing want president location location
know  vice president says wants impose death penalty drug traffickers  yet administration federal furlough program one permissive country  gave last year number furloughs drug traffickers drug pushers  people says wants execute
issue abortion difficult issue  one think wrestle  come terms
' favor abortion
' think 's good thing
' think people
question makes decision
think woman  exercise conscience religious beliefs  makes decision
lehrer  response  mr
vice president
bush  well  location furlough program unique
one nation furloughed murderers served enough time eligible parole
federal program doesn '
state programs
favor death penalty
know 's tough honest people disagree
narcotics wrapped guy goes murders police officer  think ought pay life
believe would inhibiting
going furlough men like person person  would meet  victims last escapade  rape brutalization family location
maryland would extradite person person  man furloughed  murderer  didn ' want furloughed
fundamental difference one
think people know position sanctity life
favor adoption
favor abortion
lehrer  question vice president  person
groer  yes
mr
vice president  'd like stay abortion moment might
years expressed several positions  opposing nearly forms government payment
say support abortion cases rape  incest  threat mother 's life  also support constitutional amendment ratified would outlaw abortions
abortions become illegal  think women defy law anyway  okayed supreme court  doctors perform go jail
bush  haven ' sorted penalties
know  know oppose abortion
favor adoption
get law changed  everybody make extraordinary effort take kids unwanted sometimes aborted  take - let come birth  put family loved
see  yes  position evolved
's continuing evolve  's evolving favor life
couple exceptions support - rape  incest life mother
sometimes people feel little uncomfortable talking  's much clearer
