's person 's route white house general election
make electoral map work
dramatically remake map gain oval office
's first stab trying answer question
start  person trailing person double-digits location
win location location - - best-case scenario point three largest swing states - - would tough indeed lose
's polling states  location ( number votes ) person ( r ) number %  obama ( d ) number % ( person  may number ) person ( r ) number %  obama ( d ) number % ( person  may number ) location ( number votes ) obama ( d ) number %  person ( r ) number % ( surveyusa  may number ) person ( r ) number %  obama ( d ) number % ( person  may number ) person ( number votes ) obama ( d ) number %  person ( r ) number % ( person  may number ) obama ( d ) number %  person ( r ) number % ( surveyusa  may number ) numbers suggest - -  anyway - - location long shot  location shaping big battle
sake argument  question needs answered  person get magic number number electoral college votes  like person person  wins pennsylvania  location location
without ohio location  person 's best hopes hinge flipping either virginia location effectively two main pathways white house location taken table  small variations
one revolves around flipping virginia
revolves around flipping location
historically republican states trending democratic big way last years
virginia dems made big gains last eight years  picking governorship  one house state legislature  much-celebrated victory number sen
person person  former gov
mark warner strong favorite win state 's senate seat fall
polls far mixed bag  show potential person flip state person 's number % showing last time around  virginia ( number votes ) obama ( d ) number %  person ( r ) number % ( surveyusa  may number ) person ( r ) number %  obama ( d ) number % ( person  may number ) four virginia scenarios presuming person get organization organization won number  plus virginia  number electoral college votes  get white house pulls least one following goals  number ) take location 's seven votes
location seems like reasonable target - - 's swing state voted person number narrowly switched bush number
latest polls give person lead  iowa ( number votes ) obama ( d ) number %  person ( r ) number % ( surveyusa  may number ) obama ( d ) number %  person ( r ) number % ( person  may number ) number ) win new location 's five votes
state went person number bush number  razor-thin margins time
person 's moderation immigration might able help make inroads among hispanic voters
state overall democratic lean ; west continues trend democratic  person argued positioned well
polls shown close race  new mexico ( number votes ) obama ( d ) number %  person ( r ) number % ( surveyusa  may number ) obama ( d ) number %  person ( r ) number % ( person  may number ) number ) win location 's five votes
one could bit trickier  two parties parity
state voted bill person twice  person person bush twice  current polls give person lead  person ( number votes ) person ( r ) number %  obama ( d ) number % ( person  may number ) person ( r ) number %  obama ( d ) number % ( person  april number ) number ) pick location 's number votes
state also poses problems  isn ' reach entirely
state trended republican last decades  democrats made progress won number senate race  polls currently give presumptive dem nominee governor big leads republicans
current polls put person person  much  person ( number votes ) person ( r ) number %  obama ( d ) number % ( surveyusa  may number ) person ( r ) number %  obama ( d ) number % ( person  may number )  recap  person win location one five states  's next president  even loses location location
location scenarios  location scenarios
person vowed run better traditional dems number western states like location  new location  location
nonetheless  person ' flip virginia  's location - - western states - - pivotal hopes  treasure trove nine electoral votes  nearby state
thanks radicalization gop immigration social issues  organization dems enjoyed huge upswing
whereas next nothing number elections  dems control state houses  majority house delegation  governorship one senate seat  favorable odds gaining senate seat year
polls  colorado ( number votes ) obama ( d ) number %  person ( r ) number % ( person  may number ) obama ( d ) number %  person ( r ) number % ( person  april number ) location alone doesn ' get person
else person need
person wins location person person  four scenarios get number  one accomplished  number ) pick location new mexico
number ) pick location location
number ) gain new location location
number ) win location
obviously  person win virginia location  scenarios longer necessary
time caveat big caveat  assumes person would able hold kerry states gain spots
's certain person would hold kerry states
's owing particular flaw part - - 's simply many places won narrowly number  polls currently show tight races states  constant fluctuations
failure win one person state would radically alter math obama would need pull
victory would still possible  would certainly become whole lot difficult
ultimately  person wins location location  loses location location  's conceivable could put together map makes work
would really run table
bottom line multiple scenarios obama win without winning location location
far away doable ones revolve around either flipping virginia location
end  despite campaign 's talk remaking map  could come many states closely watched number number  location  location  location  location  location  new location  location  new organization others
`` remaking `` would winning time
