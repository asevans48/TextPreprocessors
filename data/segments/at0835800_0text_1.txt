system aims send invisible  ultra-powerful laser beam aircraft hundreds miles targets  could one day alter nature aerial warfare
primarily designed strike enemy missile silos  us missile defence agency called abl answer `` rogue states `` terror groups equipped intercontinental ballistic missiles  ``
nobody knows trial balloon  new administration truly considering making first truly gigantic military/foreign policy blunder
certainly liberal ' experts ' always putting missile defense efforts - - - decades
obviously foolish dangerous time approaching genuinely effective anti-missile defense  first time sixty-year history nuclear age anxiety
never working defense

democrats follow loudly proclaimed fantasies abandon missile defense
misc  indians  misc  israelis even europeans smarter
may applaud person administration 's unilateral surrender theatrics  secretly 're going  sucker !

guess trial balloon
