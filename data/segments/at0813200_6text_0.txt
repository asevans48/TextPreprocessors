imagine concept perfect `` green ``  safe  sustainable  zero-emissions  invisible ( literally ) energy technology potential limitless power
radical environmentalists still object !
learned perused website location atlantic university 's ( fau ) center excellence ocean energy technology  pursuing r & d innovative technology anchor buoys number meters deep gulf stream equipped turbines harness slow powerful  steady  ocean-current generation electricity
depth proposed  turbines insulated damaging surface waves storms ; also deeper almost marine life  except whales
practicing engineer  personally think idea tremendous potential
assessment difficult problem overcome protection moving parts high-voltage power transmission cables notoriously corrosive effects salt-water
nonetheless  practical green attributes proposed concept  sustainable - - fuel whatsoever zero emissions invisible ( literally submerged far off-shore ) overcomes `` back yard `` ( ( nimby ) safe - radiation spent fuel rods store millennia environmentalist 's dream right
wrong !
check comments environmental website article reports fau 's project  compete devise objections   - 'm glad 're investigating impact sea life
strongly suspect 'll find doesn ' work creatures first
- humble opinion looks like installation underwater turbine create ecological disaster !
based numberd rendering looks like one would destroy ocean floor build erect thesemonstrosities
- actually  army corp engineers studied numbers numbers found slow gulf stream  disturb marine life entire climate !
gulf stream brings warmer weather way europe
sorry guys  solution energyand favorite  - adopt many systems supply electricity  won ' eventually stop earth rotating
`` nimby `` benefit
wrong  - one final point  hide means production energy  allow luxury ignoring impact
since can not  species  trust act best interests planet upon depend  designing systems absolutely `` faces ``  hidden away
perhaps   would resort ultimate ( albeit non - `` design `` ) solution  drastically reducing consumption power  limiting numbers
may unfair judge website commenters - - truth also many positive comments  well corrections inanities comments reproduced - - believe sheer ignorance revealed enormous expanse ocean  miniscule effect man-made activity gulf-stream - - never mind earth 's rotation - - indicative eco-activists general
betray radical urban roots regard little knowledge outdoors  ocean  atmosphere  solar system science general
yet fear pronouncing denouncing subjects beyond person person rather seek meaningful solutions  always resort `` object !
object !
object ! ``
whatever proposed even flimsiest grounds  even contradicts previous objections
keep mind next time radical environmentalists protest industrial project region
