fail see allowing students valid concealed weapons permit allowed carry everywhere else public ( depending state laws movie theaters  restaurants  malls  even bars states ) suddenly much likely violent college campus
firearms already college campuses would allowing actually follow law carry increase danger
adults already carry everywhere else would allowing carry across imaginary line effect judgment self defense situation
correct self defense one thing  allowing law abiding citizens right use best tools available protect safer allowing unopposed shooting spree
second point number year old ex marine ( one currently rights violated western oregon university ) different number year old teacher
yet people concealed weapons permits adults title teacher make qualified defend
already proven criminals ' follow law carry firearms campus matter law says let law abiding citizens defend legal opportunity express right
