first argument  basic principles  centrality secular conscience moral discourse
please summarize logic religious conscience presupposes secular conscience mean terms like `` open  `` `` private  ``  particular  `` objective `` used context
person  conscience mean reflective judgment reason think  things considered
conscience can not based duty god  conscience must tell us duty lies
lesson great platonic dialogue  euthyphro  stands western ethical thought story person sacrifice person stands abrahamic faiths
interrogating person 's definition righteous holy `` loved gods  `` socrates asks  holy loved gods  gods love holy
matter horn euthyphro dilemma one takes  ox religion-based morality gets gored  holiness whatever gods love  gods ' evaluation appears arbitrary subjective
hand  holiness loved holy  gods ' evaluation appears superfluous -- any reasons recognizing 's righteous must god-independent
person person challenged religious believers name single moral action performed believer could performed nonbeliever
want go say religious good reasons acting morally  reasons equally open nonreligious
unless thing secular moralconscience  thing religious moral conscience
secular conscience argue questions conscience open private -- contrary slogan contemporary secular liberalism
mean workings conscience necessarily susceptible examination others light objective standards  something objective settled way world  merely attitudes
religion ethics  conscience also open revision  thank goodness
location agree  including importance defining secular conscience  basic logic religious conscience presupposes secular one  importance addressing morally serious issues ( say  abortion  bush/iraq war  stem cell research  censorship ) moral terms
disagree whether privacy conscience `` slogan contemporary secular liberalism  ``
true liberals often argue privacy - gender person 's person employer 's business comes benefits  example
also true often frame arguments operationally - 's common hear death penalty intrinsically immoral  rather fails deter
however  also true liberals make many moral arguments
among objections voiced bush/iraq war moral one  us simply right invade country never threatened us
person point
bush 's violation international order one compelling arguments invade ( single imposrtant )  rarely articulated forceful manner  let alone defended criticized
liberals often cede ethical high ground default  implicitly acknowledging moral position may easily trumped bogus utilitarian concerns
argument `` well  invasion location doesn ' chance hell succeeding `` implicitly acknowledges moral argument may matter much us  fact  chance succeed
's easy step person person 's infamous formulation number % chance success  us put `` hope experience  ``
yes  liberals - must - much aggressive defining ethical dimensions ( ) civil governmental issues
need aggressive defending moral principles attacked  refusing retreat often less convincing arguments utility
neither location saying bush/iraq could prevented liberals better articulated moral objections
* rather issue make principles liberal conscience ( person calls `` secular `` ) part mainstream culture - often prior ascension neocons christianists
truly deranged notions like `` preventive war `` longer seem thinkable mainstream leaders
contrast  provides crackpot moral ideas free reign create havoc
* [ update  anyone familiar blogging knows fault bush administration cronies bush/iraq catastrophe  also enablers among mainstream media liberal hawks  ]
