saw saturday  pretty much agree ace 's take
probably liked monster design little though
's ugly beast seems naturalistic
agree camera motion bit much
steadier camera idea established would helped make cloverfield enjoyable
're susceptible motion sickness  see cloverfield
ever
said  great time one
shouldn ' expect profound works theatrical brilliance monster film  person doesn ' deliver
's fun works
* spoilers follow
* one thing would add ace 's take cloverfield pretty much demolishes rules cliches monster films  's worked well
ever since number godzilla  rules big monster films set  monster
scientists explaining monster 's origins maybe intentions briefing  proximate cause attack usually something mankind ( though alien whatever  're always given bit information 's usually coming )  intrepid reporter chasing story  arguments officials  nearly always get super weapon aircraft deployed stop crushed several army battalions swatted best fighters sky
get second  third fourth monster fight  recent japanese kaiju films
nearly always helpless kid caught chaos
always hate kid
presence film always contrived 's given screen time would better spent serving monster mayhem
cloverfield gives usual stuff  never way previous monster films
monster 's origins intentions never explained
shows commences wrecking town
intrepid reporter becomes fleeting glances flat screens electronics store  get plot surprises even seconds
kid jeopardy becomes tag along main characters
opening film gives away 's going happen characters  're removed pretend care thus left take scenes less certainty going survive
plus camera work makes whole film visceral previous monster film
wait attack begins effect know 's coming  exactly  time get used lives somewhat vacuous characters  get thrown insanity
unlike previous monster films  never get distant shot creature marches inevitably harbor get wide shot creature  well  even ends bang
never get ground-level shots monster stomping trains neighborhoods
get one low shot looking  's memorable
person takes usual kaiju kabuki  making original monster film made decades maybe ever  even though follows basic plot trajectory monster films follow  monster arrives  monster attacks  stuff falls apart people die
heroism cool competence previous monster films  particularly way military portrayed  film doesn ' give grand arrival army way previous monster films usually
military appears amid chaos nearly kills main characters since 're army monster
struck playing much like probably would actual gigantic space whatever monster ever wreak havoc major city ( though military would probably take little longer get tanks scene )
little plot gets exposed quick conversations military officer lead character  even isn ' handled way monster films usually
make main character key monster 's destruction somehow  military either resisting deferring
location  main character another guy trying survive  military officer spends maybe number seconds explaining situation
works
every time cloverfield jumps past monster movie cliche  works
though half expected get mad location  liked
left bit headache  liked
