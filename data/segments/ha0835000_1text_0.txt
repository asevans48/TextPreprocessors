one unfair  maybe 'm wrong one unfair criticisms president spent inordinate amount time beefing  separation-of-powers sense  power executive branch
strengthened based weakening 've felt experienced previous administrations
think incoming administration benefit strengthening engaged executive branch
expect cede power back legislative branch
vice president  well  guess get 're faced problems deal every day  appreciate things 've put place
exceed constitutional authority suggested  president believes  believe deeply strong executive  think 's essential day age  think person administration likely cede authority back congress
think 'll find  given challenge face  'll need authority muster
