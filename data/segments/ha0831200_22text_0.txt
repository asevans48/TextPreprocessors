person person offers ( republican ) party line oddly flat column today 's location post
instead offering specifics person plans change gop rebuild voter trust even acknowledging need boehner instead insisted voters got hoodwinked supporting democrats person person 's talk moderation  's interesting argument  begs question number americans vote
issues came election
republicans fought hard make relevant  person person plumber certainly everyone talking redistributionism
end  people still voted person person democrats house senate
happens  agree boehner  house minority leader misses point
democrats won yesterday republicans still haven ' rebuilt credibility american voters number
person says voters didn ' give democrats mandate big government spending  's though voters much choice
republicans gave big government solutions spending   least democrats weren ' hypocrites
person says republicans continue oppose big-government solutions offer rational superior alternatives policy
's expect loyal opposition  course republicans around nation want see
person gop better expect compete national elections
convince voters days k street projects  power won ' corrupt like contract america
voters know republicans won ' spend like drunken sailors given opportunity lead
nothing person 's essay speaks
instead  hear  tired party line
perhaps voices speaking
