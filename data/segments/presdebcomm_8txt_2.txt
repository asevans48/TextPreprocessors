problem see many guns getting hands children  criminals  people  whatever reason  kind history stalking domestic abuse really able get guns
think assault weapons problem
favor closing gun show loophole
fact  cast tie-breaking vote close  majority house representatives went way
's still pending
could get agreement  maybe could pass final days congress

think toughen enforcement gun laws ones already books enforced much effectively
restrictions placed congress last couple years
think - - last years think unfortunate

gun-free zone around every school country
think measures like important
child safety trigger locks mandatory basis  others
moderator  governor
bush  well  starts enforcing law
say loud clear somebody 're going carry gun illegally  're going arrest
're going sell gun illegally  need arrested
commit crime gun  needs absolute certainty law
means local law enforcement officials need help federal level
programs like project exile federal government intensifies arresting people illegally use guns
haven ' done good job federal level recently
'm going make priority
secondly  ' think ought selling guns people shouldn '
's support instant background checks gun shows
one reasons instant background check instantly know whether somebody gun
texas tried something innovative
's lot talk trigger locks guns sold future
support
said want trigger lock make gun safe  come get one free
're distributing state texas free
think ought raise age juvenile carry handgun number number

recent investigation number texas got - - given concealed weapons permits spite fact records
`` location location times `` spent lot ink going
anything would affect hunters sportsmen  rifles  shotguns  existing handguns
think sensible gun safety measures warranted
look  year - - aftermath columbine  location  places country nation shocked weapons hands wrong people
woman bought guns two boys killing columbine said give name fill form  would bought guns
conceivably could prevented tragedy
moderator  back question differences gun control
governor  point view  vice president

mean  fact - - even though state wants  guns schools
reason 's difficult schools control recent years flood cheap handguns widely available kids finding ways get ahold
think look situation exists location location compared country world  seems pretty obvious respect rights hunters sportsmen  need common sense gun safety steps stem flood guns getting wrong hands
bush  yeah  question  also needs strong enforcement law
kid feels like - - doesn ' matter gun comes  could cheap gun  expensive gun
matters something person 's head says going consequence
state toughen juvenile justice laws
added beds
're tough
