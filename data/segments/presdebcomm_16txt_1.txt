aware  crime rampant cities
location area - - 'm sure 's happened elsewhere - - number-year-olds carrying guns school

'm asking  stand gun control  plan
simpson  governor person
clinton  support right keep bear arms
live state half adults hunting fishing licenses
believe way checking hand guns 're sold  check criminal history  mental health history  age people buying
therefore support brady bill would impose national waiting period unless state location done  automate records
automate records  ' waiting period  least check
also think frankly restrictions assault weapons whose purpose kill
need give police fighting chance urban areas gangs building
third thing would say - - doesn ' bear directly gun control  's important - - need police street
crime bill would put police street  killed session filibuster senate  mostly republican senators  think 's shame didn ' pass  think made law - - brady bill  waiting period
also believe offer college scholarships people agree work police officers  think  reduce military forces  let people earn military retirement coming working police officers
thirty years ago three police officers street every crime ; today three crimes every police officer
communities real success putting police officers near schools kids carry weapons  get weapons schools  blocks  've seen crime go
location 's number - percent drop crime rate last year work mayor increasing police force

question
audience question  'd like ask governor person  attribute rising costs health care medical profession  think problem lies elsewhere
specific proposals tackle problem
clinton  've people talk health care problems guess anything else  across america - - know  people 've lost jobs  lost businesses  give jobs sick children
let try answer way
let 's start premise
spend number % income nation earth health care  yet insure fewer people
number million people without insurance - - see time
hundred thousand americans month lost health insurance last number years
analyze 're line countries  come following conclusions
number one  spend least $ number billion year insurance  administrative cost  bureaucracy  government regulation wouldn ' spent nation
judgment  drastic simplification basic health insurance policies country  comprehensive everybody
employers would cover employees  government would cover unemployed
number number  think take specifically insurance companies require make significant change way rate people big community pools
think tell pharmaceutical companies ' keep raising drug prices three times rate inflation
think take medical fraud
think help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine
've recommended doctors given set national practice guidelines follow guidelines raises presumption didn ' anything wrong
think system primary preventive clinics inner cities rural areas people access health care
key control cost maintain quality
need system managed competition us covered big groups choose doctors hospitals  wide range  incentive control costs
think - - think mr
perot agree  national commission health care providers health care consumers set ceilings keep health costs line inflation  plus population growth
let say  people say ' location
cover number % people insurance premiums much cheaper rest location  location  location location
plan cover everybody premiums two-thirds rest country
important
's big human problem devastating economic problem location  'm going send plan within first number days presidency
's terribly important
simpson  thank
sorry cut short president person  health care reform
bush  say something
' want stampede
