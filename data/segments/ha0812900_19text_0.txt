shouldn ' gas-tax holiday idea died hillary person 's campaign hopes last tuesday
according economist person person  explains new york times might limited value keeping congress something even stupid response rising gas prices
problem caplan 's explanation creates stupid policies necessarily exclusive one another  caplan 's advice makes sense
gas-tax holiday doesn ' preclude foolish policy ; anything  invites ideas like windfall-profits taxes
government seek recoup lost revenue manner  rather something useful like cost-cutting
's hillary clinton wedded two together
george bush would veto tax scheme year  president person would veto next year  either president person president person person would sign windfall-profits tax actively encourage congress pass one
's long past time little straight talk  friends  uselessness gas-tax holiday
gas prices skyrocket federal taxes gasoline  removal shave $ numbernumber fill-up
holiday solves nothing fact makes problem worse  initially lower price increase demand  drive prices higher  reapplication tax exacerbate
delays consideration responsible energy policy could actually address price gasoline well rest energy policy congress muffed last six years number/numberin sense  person person right  holiday nothing election-year pander
number/number attack made clear war would create pressures oil supply  well rapid increase demand location location  us needed start planning long term energy
needed start drilling producing oil much higher quantities  needed build refineries produce gasoline ; 're importing number % latter  number rise significantly without refinery capacity nation
expanding would lower prices create american jobs  beneficial economy
also needed less pandering renewable energy sources
instead focusing nuclear energy clean coal  offered billions subsidies mandates ethanol  makes energy use less efficient begun seriously distort food markets around world
congress eliminated regional mixture mandates bush person person disrupted major portion narrow refining capacity favor one national mixture allow maximum efficiency  therefore cost reductions  supply
none measures got serious consideration kind short-term thinking exemplified gas-tax holiday
would take years  congress said number  bring assets line sufficient force make impact energy prices
well   years later  paying short-term thinking
years  listening excuse
john person  hillary person  person person better start offering real solutions energy crisis expect ever solve
require long-term restructuring energy production necessarily require us produce resources domestically speculative solutions continue develop
otherwise  holiday us see spend weekend pumps waiting weekly ration fuel
