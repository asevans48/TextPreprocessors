debate global warming theory turning contest two explanatory models climate change  human activity solar activity
comes news solar activity may declining  signaling may ( alarmism ) entering period global cooling
investor 's business daily explains  person tapping  solar researcher project director location 's national research council  among looking sun evidence increase sunspot activity
solar activity fluctuates number-year cycle
far cycle  sun disturbingly quiet
lack increased activity could signal beginning known maunder minimum  event occurs every couple centuries last long century
event occurred numberth century
observation sunspots showed extraordinarily low levels magnetism sun  little number-year cycle
