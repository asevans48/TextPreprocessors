location location discontentsby ddayso two big charges coming person campaign location  numerous incidents voter suppression intimidation local precinct sites swung vote clinton ;  actually won location ( front page person 's campaign website graphic showing location results `` person number delegates  person number delegates `` )
based talking lot precinct captains people know  speak issues
first  delegate count
spoke person person immediate aftermath caucuses  basically tried dismiss person campaign statement  saying national delegates selected would determined election state party convention april
pressed little later  asking essentially `` things equal  assuming remained race  would person wind dnc delegates  ``
refused give straight answer
later learned derby pretty much known person supporter  pretty much trying tell `` 'll make delegate count reflect voters  ``
nsdp backtracked  ``
national convention delegates awarded
said  delegate preferences remain unchanged april number  calculations national convention delegates circulated associated press correct
look forward county state conventions choose delegates nominee nevadans support  ``
face  many made argument invalidates caucus process
agree  's way electoral college subverts national election process
states weight caucuses get candidates rural areas ( location 's case  's really rounding error gives little importance areas outside location location clark county )
aftermath election  ' renege
agree person person media conventional wisdom ' dismiss real delegate count want
unfortunately
thing understand significance caucuses party building
primary controlled ( paid ) state ; caucus controlled ( paid ) parties
democrats number nevadans turn ; number number
get number people amounts democratic party meeting  capture information  excite  turn election day
states democratic party isn ' organized politics part dna ( believe  's vegas )  caucuses actually play important role
're horrible picking president  great strengthening party
downside  especially state like location new caucuses inexperienced caucus-goers  're disorganized mess
brings charges voting rights violations
person person covers fair bit today  caucus room talked lot people caucus  takes track somewhat
location state democratic party  setting caucuses  find number precinct chairs run
aren ' number nonpartisan activists sitting around location ready run caucuses  chairs ended people supported one candidate another  would guess disproportionate amount supported person
say precinct chairs cheated anything  perception bias already ingrained votes cast ( lot organizers ended coming location location  )
addition  state put multiple precnicts site ( number-some precincts number sites )  never told voters  expected people never caucused show implicitly know go  leading chaos
furthermore  precinct captains ( tasked organizing voters respective candidates ) weren ' entirely knowledgeable process either
told assertive working rules
many
lot hoopla surrounding at-large caucuses strip employees big hotels
piecing together evidence  's clear strong efforts labor leaders within culinary workers union get folks vote person
's also clear invited backlash
picture top sign  `` support union  support hillary  `` paid person campaign  handed culinary workers union members
afsmce organizers location country organizing inside union getting people caucus person
addition  heard rank file union wasn ' happy leadership begin  dues gone without accompanying increase wages
result strip caucuses hillary won number number  projection number number person
real-world impact lawsuit brought person allies shut strip caucuses  particularly bill person 's comments employees ' votes would `` count five times much `` regular nevadans
complete utter falsehood  coming former president  weight
apparently soundbite played location location tv radio
statements teacher 's union lawsuit designed protect voter rights  impact would shut strip caucuses prevent people participating
making wild claims employees would get vote workplace  weren ' true
ground  people got message  culinary workers union absolutely painted caricature `` powerful union bosses `` trying steal vote
hillary 's success clark county must attributed part
like rest media  went one casinos observe caucus ( hillary beat barack person  number-number )
fascinating hilarious ' wait write  ' regret
media 's obsession caucuses diverted attention ones vegas area
alleged voter intimidation voter suppression took place ( see   )
transparency media spotlight  think would less opportunity
let 's clear charges
many cases  rules weren ' properly explained
's stoller  central claim organization camp clinton-affiliated chairs telling people show number  number shutting doors caucus-goers number  number instead number
aside fact party rules conflict point  many caucus goers really wanted event start end quickly  working
middle caucus attended  third room emptied shift change ( votes counted )
words  good reasons shut doors number  numberi heard one report person precinct captain trying get doors shut number  number
truth  precinct chair discretion keep open
muddled
charges  like voter cards moved hillary camp ( appears party didn ' expect high turnout didn ' enough cards voter registration forms )  hillary caucus-goers attempting counted different precincts site  precinct captains telling caucus goers non-viable candidates go home instead right make new choice  electioneering places forbidden  etc
take lot sharp elbows thrown
supporters candidate assertive trying best
hillary precinct captains may little prepared little experienced kind hardball politics
's universally true
's favorite on-the-ground story desmoulins mydd  edwards precinct captain ( talked lot last night )  end first allignment approached  person number  person number  edwards number  kucinic number uncommitted number
number campaigns made short pitch number kucinic supporters said would come edwards would make us viable
uncommitted voters also agreed come would make us viable  one person voter one person voter
three voters short  could let number minutes expire without least getting number uncommitted ( members viable groups can not reallign nv rules )
went person group explained helped reach viability  could deprive person least number delegates without hurting cause
urged move least number people uncommitted  would least make mathematically possible us reach number needed viability
surprise  person captain idea talking could understand either move supporters uncommitted  would suggest edwards supporters would go person failed viable
explained quickly less convinced time ran
pointed math wrong  could get voters back numbernd number minutes
agreed one person supporter volunteered move
pleaded one two others assisting move  person captain quite rightly began point time
( told organization captain would come group viable  credit  put trying help edwards expense  )
lot inexperienced caucus goers inexperienced precinct captains inexperienced precinct chairs  's question people took advantage opportunity
idea impacted vote one way realistic
person 's precinct organizers organized  took advantage lot opportunities
suppression
' say  really
'd concerned person person obama robocall  obama people
know person campaign taking rallying cry potential dangerous
trying leverage idea person campaign cheated winning black voters location location  could get extremely ugly
would hope would step back brink
person campaign ; bill person saying personally heard union rep threaten employee credible
plays growing racial gap saw display little bit person casino caucus
's scorched-earth strategy person campaign call ghosts number location number location context democratic primary allegations murky
cause severe rift party could implications november
' think anybody comes location looking good  sadly
election gotten high school petty  issues pushed side
feeling missed moment
