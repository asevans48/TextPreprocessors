location post editorial board rips person person calls iron timetable  doesn ' quite capture willful ignorance obama shows location
post notes  person person  fact person wrote policy location speaking commanders ground determine facts  concludes person ultimately indifferent war 's outcome  's real problem
person stick misc policy  good country  ' afford cut last tie left
make sense
course  one seriously thinks  except maybe person person
obama won ' talk generals first knows laugh room suggested could win war retreating
even iraqis  want establish sovereignty  want continuing misc partnership least next several years  especially increasingly hegemonic location next door
reversal fisa reform lesser extent public financing  though  person can not afford reverse location  regardless wrong events proved
left nearly pitched overboard month fisa vote  weakening location prove fatal presidential aspirations
could even result losing nomination  floor-vote momentum gains ground  surely person departs impossible number-month iron timetable
's headline post uses unintentionally deceptive
implies person shows strength misdirected fashion
however  exact oppposite 's demonstration weakness
