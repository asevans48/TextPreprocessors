guess person wins nomination 's going mccain-powell ticket  hillary nominee
conservative 's perspective would painful
froma raw-politics perspective would brilliant
would  first  give liberals emotional escape voting woman
columns nation  vanity fair  la times  show increasing revulsion clintons among liberals
liberals could console themselves-reassure truly good people-by voting black vice president
second  former secretary state  national security advisor  chairman joint chiefs staff  vice president  would person powerfully hillary 's total lack foreign policy experience
going counter
warren christopher
person person
madeleine albright
third  smoldering resentment black community towards hillary ( beating person  rather clintons beat )  would chance republican ticket pick additional ten percent black vote
subtract votes democratic totals add republican totals
enough blue states turn red
update  person person writes  's first 've heard idea probably good reason - aint
gon na
happen
doubt powell wants
would never fly convention given powell 's harsh criticisms bush
person seen architect war democrats - sure thing won ' pick many dems regardless color
powell always seen organization organization organization organization race traitor
interesting fantasy almost certainly non starter
