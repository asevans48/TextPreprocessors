quest play ubuntu linux  've look around alternatives software use windows
firefox  opera  thunderbird linux versions work like charm  fortunately  difficulty finding feedreader liked
feedreaders critical tool bloggers  monitor dozens different newspapers  wire services  blogs keep moment
without reliable flexible feedreader  'd sunk
tried using newsfox  embedded organization feedreader firefox  didn ' quite flexibility liked timing  retention  grouping
akregator  newsgator liferea good points  spoiled sharpreader omea  fell short options well
've used google reader  helps making reader portable  even less control order  grouping  retention hosted service
eventually  discovered rss owl  could never figure get run linux
linux version installer package  'm adept enough ubuntu figure get run
instead  installed windows machine see whether would make suitable substitute omea
've problems corruption omea database  causing entries get corrupted  repeated rebuilds fixes haven ' resolved problem
rss owl loads faster  cleaner  almost options like omea
also highlights updated posts  new entries  tell bloggers edited existing entries
person plays misc scripts windows  allowing see video clips without open pages browser
far  least  haven ' seen hint corruption files omea
'm going keep using rss owl proves unworthy
hopefully  'll able figure load ubuntu  needed first place
