pdf regardless  op wrong merely perpetuating fear-mongering
example  section numberb simply says people without acceptable healthcare ( eligible acceptable healthcare ) taxed ~ number %  excess taxable  gross adjusted income
basically  'd taxed nothing
acceptable healthcare described sub-section ( d ) basically healthcare  including government provided healthcare ( veterans affairs  medicare  medicaid etc  )

moreover  whole illegal immigrant thing disingenuous play words
bill would exempt non-resident aliens  means people visas ( opposed people greencards  like ) ' acceptable healthcare taxed
