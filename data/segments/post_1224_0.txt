since children last thousand years key aspect carrying bloodlines  holding onto property family  providing much needed extra hands income  fairly logical
'm rather surprised even challenge assertion children main reason traditional marriage throughout history  'd glad look research later date
adoption agencies  example  sperm/egg banks private agencies  doesn ' mean regulated
location famous example catholic adoption agency  same-sex ruling judges fiat people  can not prefer traditional married couple same-sex one
disagree agency shutting point  strongly opposed government forcing upon religion  happening continue happen government forces same-sex marriage society
laissez-faire  'd one thing  government recognizing overrules religious beliefs ( much separation church state ) forces everyone abide rulings
same-sex marriage exactly status society forces society accept falsity men women
two moms dads good (  remember  longer prefer traditional couple same-sex one refuse based beliefs give eggs  etc  bank ) mom dad children  two dads must give children benefits mom dad
doesn '  men women different
thanks discussion
