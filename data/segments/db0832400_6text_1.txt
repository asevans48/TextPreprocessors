's like magical incantation understood members tribe
literal term ' possibly meaningful people unless think something baked goods
yet scream shout near frenzy mere mention phrase
's clearly pavlovian talk radio conditioning
past election noticed new catch phrase
minute conservative breathes word `` card check  `` supporters completely lose minds
ratchets saying `` lose right secret ballot `` come completely unhinged even energy unleash someone says `` 're going beat terrorists  ``
's weird
obviously right  organization organization organization business entities working hard prime public hostile unions able organize simply people sign instead requiring on-site elections front boss  purpose employee free choice act `` card check  ``
's set talking points  easily obtained mr google associated builders contractors
features usual nonsense ( hilariously hypocritical notion believe one freedom job one civic life
hah ! )
even though makes sense  gives people way talk something 's rather difficult explain
passion come
get people really feel 's important stop unions getting people simple opt-in  ``
pollster `` person person speaking organization organization organization location location last week  makes clear  `` 'm afraid employees passes  `` person said  ``

's long ugly  bloody  deadly history corporations labor unions fighting nineteenth early twentieth centuries

labor violence today almost entirely labor unions
easily believe reason afl-cio wants `` streamline `` process intimidating workers signing authorization cards -- and ' dare risk secret ballot
( doesn ' cite specific examples recent union violence  may think `` sopranos `` hbo documentary series  )
obviously another example right 's post modernist inversion - - - site elections often exercises intimidation management keep union organizing
thomas frank op-ed wall street journal morning lays real framework debate  campaign  recall  debate card check supposed principle  democracy  sacredness secret ballot
however  pointed months ago  union-certification elections often ' meet basic democratic requirements
supervisors routinely hold captive-audience meetings workers preparation elections ; management commonly threatens close shop union wins ; antiunion employees frequently rewarded pro-union employees sometimes fired
may surprise learn democracy isn ' really main concern card-check 's opponents
's unions
changing rules make easier organize
