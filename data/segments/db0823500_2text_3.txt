seems sincere  person religious leaders say want reduce abortions would spending time talking people like reichert need people unfettered access birth control rather lecturing liberals already support efforts years
course  one would assume person really wants help prevent unwanted pregnancy rather wants make abortions - - - sex - - - shameful abortions sex subject `` punishment `` childbirth
seems pals would good persuading right stop demonizing sex birth control `` persuading `` women give birth
( way  giving child adoption hell lot complicated exercising feel-good `` juno option  ``
ask women went nine months pregnancy gave kids `` simple ``  )
two assaults women 's reproductive rights - - - `` gentle `` persuasion new friends say `` want make women realize ' need abortions `` combined harsh assault religious right limit women 's access birth control makes obvious battle fought twin fronts
one day soon  'm sure 'll see brilliant compromise brokered democrats republicans - - - republicans reluctantly allow government `` force `` people dispense birth control consciences democrats reluctantly agree 's necessary force women children
lovely bipartisan outcome
'll fight damned thing states  thus making sure important players still careers
