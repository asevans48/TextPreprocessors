plan laid location location worth thinking  supposedly could get international support plan  looks like location board
( good  none vast german oil reserves headed location ! )
one location 's weakest spots  might give us leverage nuclear program exploit
get really persnickety  things could start happening fragile refineries
would location respond
sun suggests price oil would go even result location 's retaliation
wouldn ' mitigated lower gasoline prices
since world 's refineries could longer sell gasoline location  would effectively increase available supply worldwide therefore drop price
right
interesting idea like see innovative solutions proposed  especially peaceful ones
said  flaws plan  i sanctions ' really work well autocracies
( sanctions helped pressure south africa remove apartheid  though abominably segregated susceptible pressure white citizens  )
's legitimate use sanctions international policythey work impoverish cripple adversaries keep getting powerfuland moral case built well
didn ' knock person power  haven ' brought person person person person low
countries like  leaders little comfortable saying protesters oh  want gasoline
napalm
location 's government brutal pretty well insulated power protest
mullahs would increase power domestically rationing gasoline make tidy profit
control means distribution
ii
speaking person  remember un sanctions location  killing three bajillion misc children day
creeps like george galloway media enablers would happy stir opinion evil us policy blockading location  look children starving enough fuel start tractors plow fields  yadda  person person point humanitarian relief proposed  trickle gasoline ( power ambulances  combines  school buses  mind  never anything military  perish thought ) allowed
sounds familiar  's exactly happened oil food ( except oil exports instead gas imports ; sales supposed go humanitarian aid )
person began using allowances relief oil exports buy influence around globe
guarantee won ' turn oil-for-food ii  petrol plutonium
isn ' serious objection plan stands  possibility 'd like know guarded
iii
ways around sales embargo even blockade
's going police
oil-for-food shows difficult keep sanctions working effectively
even weren ' un bureaucracy corrupt  makes us think  oilman emirates gazprom heavy totalfinaelf suit isn ' going try sneak go-juice tidy profit
raised incentives
could end enriching criminals well mullahs
' see working without us navy enforcing blockadewhich part planand could get ugly real quick
iv
'm afraid fairy-tale substitute real plan change situation location
probably won ' hurt things  distracts us actually changing regime  breaking sponsorship worldwide terrorism ending nuclear nightmare
makes hell lot sense subsidizing nuclear program location location  put proposal category much-vaunted idea working domestic opposition groups magically overthrow government day
( yeah  engineer coup
always works well us  )
may useful instrument policy  deluding think clamp brakes mullahs
said last year  response misc repression  location 's grip strong  orwell machines good   embargo gas think buy us time  weaken location 's military
' pretend policy   make us safer
