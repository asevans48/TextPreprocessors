first  people see want see
personally seen many polls gay marriage issue majority 've seen indicate americans favor kind gay marriage whether called marriage civil union
article clearly biased toward poll results favorable frc 's side argument
accuracy polls always unsure highly question results polls listed argument
second  whether people agree banning sex marriage essentially irrelevant
majority necessarily rule country
majority one point thought slavery acceptable make justifiable
prejudice prejudice regardless many people get back
