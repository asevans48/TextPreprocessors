campaign stunt democrat person person  candidate numberth district us house seat location  seems backfiredin predictable fashion
candidate  might appears fairly naked attempt bribing voters  offered reimburse motorists drove gas station district  difference current price per gallon ( $ numbernumber ) price per gallon opponent  congressman mark person  came office ( $ numbernumber )
stunt produced massive traffic jam  many angry motorists
course  motorists stuck traffic burning fuel idling  going nowhere
someone needs contact al gore  aware fellow democrat needlessly contributing greenhouse gas emissions  mention balance payments deficit
one thing candidate seals seems missed first six years mark person served congress  gas prices change much
since democrats took congress  almost doubled less two years
course silly blame world wide increase gas prices democrats taking congress
rabid bush haters find reason blame president person person everything gone wrong world last number years  isn ' fair ask different last two years prior six
