kids already
's illegal carry drinking
people dont `` flash guns around `` everywhere else carry  act responsibly  carry campus 're gon na `` go ``
plenty college kids dont even drink actually adults common sense
anyone permit gets caught drinking carrying  thier license revoked
permit  dont want anything risk loosing
conceal carriers number times less likely commit crime someone without permit
fact
people argue carrying uninformed
takes number minutes mr google get facts
trust cop firing back killer
fact  conceal weapon carriers shoot cop
practice cops
cops qualify weapon year
practice little betwwen time
conceal carriers practice atleast month
child sitting classroom doors barricaded man gun coldly shooting people  damned right 'd hope someone  anyone  would save daughters life
even better  daughter given right defend life campus anywhere else may
doubt  ask research see facts
studies organization  states  atf studies etc
