others said government action could limited keeping banks failing  intervention could strictly limited keeping banking system defaulting
congress prove ' stop one potato chip  using precedent set earlier broadly bail everyone affected lending crisis wall street journal reports voters may seen enough  perhaps happened off-election year  like number number  common sense would prevail
people would understand government exist guarantee investment risk  foolish choices often result financial loss
