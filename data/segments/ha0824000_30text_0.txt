yesterday  watched prime-time content democratic convention preparation speech hillary clinton
hadn ' tuned day number scheduling reasons ; 'm live shows state fair number patriot week
struck day number themes sounded stage made little sense number  sounded like rerun numberall night long  one dreary speaker another took misc overwhelming stage  talked two basic issues  misery george bush
seems rather remarkable  since george bush isn ' running president  since almost everyone outside location understands
number  theme made sense  since person person wanted defeat bush election  person person isn ' george bush  time speakers lazy even make mcsame case
democrats took control chambers congress number
one might expected democratic convention focus achievements party legislation period   might make extraordinarily short convention circumstances
instead  person person came stage air grievances bush administration hadn ' helped
viewers might asked  person didn ' democrats anything help last two years
congress must irrelevant democrats
maybe 'd us favor quit feel way
mostly  though  democrats talking cameras anything positive offer misc voters
gave plenty sob stories  plenty vitriol  plenty arguments way make happier would elect person person
one wonder whether misc voters respond kind person povich-like spectacle  least better nominee actually run george bush  lost almost four points nationwide
