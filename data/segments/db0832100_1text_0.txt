non-negotiableby digbygreenwald talk left sounding small alarms person 's intelligence advisor person person 's definitely something keep close eye
've speculated intelligence community going put lot pressure new administration endorse form torture pledge `` get backs `` caught
' get way  cause lot trouble
greenwald 's post today points person said doesn ' believe waterboarding  good
thinks debate  also good
plenty evidence 's favor rendition  warrantless wiretapping although 's obviously comfortable way bush administration went business  greenwald points addendum  incriminating aspect person 's views  opinion  support bush administration 's `` enhanced interrogation techniques  ``
since says opposes waterboarding isn ' record opposing anything else  one reasonably assume must include combination things like stress positions  forced nudity  hypothermia  sleep deprivation  exploitation paranoias  extreme isolation  hanging wrists  threats  previously forbidden techniques authorized bush administration
'm trying get ahead
person talked replacement person person 's potentially problematic
person comes explicitly says use techniques greenwald lists  anything else construed torture  makes sure subordinates know means exactly  'm quite worried effects foreign policy
tries split baby compromise  automatically lose huge portion moral authority home abroad
could go back secretly torturing spying government past  - - - political ramifications got - - - let 's hope
anyway  's intelligence types want
want immunity torture ( excuse  `` enhanced interrogation `` ) want public
' think 's going back
torture negotiable ' redefined `` smoothed `` anything else
one bright line
give person benefit doubt point  course - - - nothing 's announced
'm nervous
institutional pressure going acute 'm reassured presence people like person person
