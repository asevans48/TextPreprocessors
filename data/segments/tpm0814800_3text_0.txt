today  people seem think 've discovered brand new cause  something one ever thought
many believe need end nuclear programs hostile governments president talk leaders location location  haven ' tried talking governments repeatedly past two decades

quarter century ago  president person person declared  `` dream see day nuclear weapons banished face earth  ``
dream
distant difficult goal
must proceed toward prudently pragmatically  focused concern security security allies depend us
cold war ended almost twenty years ago  time come take measures reduce dramatically number nuclear weapons world 's arsenals
time location location show kind leadership world expects us  tradition misc presidents worked reduce nuclear threat mankind
highest priority must reduce danger nuclear weapons ever used
weapons  still important deter attack weapons mass destruction us allies  represent abhorrent indiscriminate form warfare known man
quite literally  possess means destroy mankind
must seek ensure nuclear weapons never used
working closely allies rely nuclear umbrella security  would ask joint chiefs staff engage comprehensive review aspects nuclear strategy policy
would keep open mind responsible proposals
time  must continue deploy safe reliable nuclear deterrent  robust missile defenses superior conventional forces capable defending location location allies
seek reduce size nuclear arsenal lowest number possible consistent security requirements global commitments
today deploy thousands nuclear warheads
hope move rapidly possible significantly smaller force
serious differences  end cold war  location location location longer mortal enemies
two countries possess overwhelming majority world 's nuclear weapons  special responsibility reduce number
believe reduce nuclear forces lowest level judge necessary  prepared enter new arms control agreement location reflecting nuclear reductions seek
able agree location binding verification measures based currently effect start agreement  enhance confidence transparency
close consultation allies  would also like explore ways location reduce - - hopefully eliminate - - deployments tactical nuclear weapons europe
also believe work location build confidence missile defens e program  including initiatives sharing early warning data prior notification missile launches
areas work partnership location strengthen protections weapons mass destruction
would seriously consider location 's recent proposal work together globalize intermediate range nuclear forces treaty
would also redouble common efforts reduce risk nuclear  chemical  biological weapons may fall hands terrorists unfriendly governments
believe also begin dialogue location strategic nuclear issues
important shared interests location begin discussing ways achieve greatest possible transparency cooperation nuclear force structure doctrine
work location encourage conformity practices four nuclear weapon states recognized non-proliferation treaty  including working toward nuclear arsenal reductions toward moratorium production additional fissile material
believe must also address nuclear testing
president pledge continue america 's current moratorium testing  also begin dialogue allies  us senate  identify ways move forward limit testing verifiable manner undermine security viability nuclear deterrent
would include taking another look comprehensive test ban treaty see done overcome shortcomings prevented entering force
opposed treaty number  said time would keep open mind future developments
would support development new type nuclear weapon absolutely essential viability deterrent  results making possible decreases size nuclear arsenal  furthers global nuclear security goals
would cancel work so-called robust nuclear earth penetrator  weapon make strategic political sense
finally  can not achieve non-proliferation goals
must strengthen existing international treaties institutions combat proliferation  develop new ones necessary
move quickly nations negotiate fissile material cut-off treaty end production dangerous nuclear materials
international community needs improve ability interdict spread nuclear weapons material proliferation security initiative
need increase funding non-proliferation efforts  including cooperative threat reduction programs established landmark nunn-lugar legislation  ensure highest possible standards security existing nuclear materials
number  international conference meet review non-proliferation treaty
president  seize opportunity strengthen enhance aspects non-proliferation regime
need strengthen enforcement so-called `` atoms peace `` bargain insisting countries receive benefits peaceful nuclear cooperation must return dismantle receive violate withdraw npt
need increase iaea funding enhance intelligence support receives
also need reverse burden proof comes discovering whether nation cheating npt commitments
organization shouldn ' play cat-and-mouse games prove country compliance
suspected violators prove compliance
establish requirement un security council international transfers sensitive nuclear technology must disclosed advance international authority organization  require undisclosed transfers deemed illicit subject interdiction
finally  enforce treaty obligations  organization member states must willing impose sanctions nations seek withdraw
need enlist willing partners global battle nuclear proliferation
support us-india civil nuclear accord means strengthening relationship world 's largest democracy  involving location fight proliferation
engage actively location location improve security nuclear stockpiles weapons materials  construct secure global nuclear order eliminates likelihood proliferation possibility nuclear conflict
improve national multilateral tools catch reverse illicit nuclear programs  convinced civilian nuclear energy critical part fight global warming
civilian nuclear power provides way location location responsible nations achieve energy independence reduce dependence foreign oil gas
order take advantage civilian nuclear energy  must better job ensuring remains civilian
nations use pretense civilian nuclear programs cover nuclear weapons programs
need build international consensus exposes deception  holds nations accountable
can not continue allowing nations enrich reprocess uranium  ostensibly civilian purposes  stand impotently develop weapons programs
effective way prevent deception limit spread enrichment reprocessing
persuade countries forego enrichment reprocessing  would support international guarantees nuclear fuel supply countries renounce enrichment reprocessing  well establishment multinational nuclear enrichment centers participate
nations seek nuclear fuel legitimate civilian purposes able acquire need international supervision
one suggestion location others made location
unfortunately  misc government far rejected idea
perhaps enough outside pressure encouragement  persuaded change minds late
would seek establish international repository spent nuclear fuel could collect safely store materials overseas might otherwise reprocessed acquire bomb-grade materials
even possible international center could make unnecessary open proposed spent nuclear fuel storage facility location mountain location
long list steps need take
long single answer crisis  easy answers
long nation meet dire challenge alone none indifferent outcome
location location can not stop spread nuclear weapons unilateral action
must lead concerted persistent multilateral efforts
powerful  location 's ability defend allies threat nuclear attack depends ability encourage effective international cooperation
must strengthen accords institutions make cooperation possible
problem face poses greater threat us world nuclear proliferation
time followers hateful remorseless ideology willing destroy destroy us  threat suicide bombers means wreak incompreh ensible devastation call entire world action
civilized nations world must act one suffer consequences thought remote threat mutually assured destruction could deter responsible states thinking unthinkable
americans always risen challenges time
always done successfully hiding history  making history ; encouraging sometimes reluctant world follow lead  defend civilization old mistakes old animosities  folly relying policies longer keep us safe
want keep country love served life secure freedom
want us rise challenges times  generations us rose
incumbent location  nation earth  lead building foundations stable enduring peace  peace built strength commitment  transformative ideals founded  ability see around corner history  courage wisdom make new better choices
matter dangerous threats face day  still remains within power make time another  better world inherited
friends  running president
