person person  huge assist misc media  accused george bush playing electoral politics otherwise unremarkable rather general condemnation appeasement misc knesset
bush never mentioned anyone name made one reference specific person speech  republican senator number  frame remarks referring suggested cut ties location engage enemies terrorist groups like hamas
country whose ambassador location called location s****y little country reveals indeed engaged hamas  least informally  series contacts constitutes relations  regardless whatever sophistry kouchner utilizes
's distinction without difference  flies face west 's stated policy non-negotiation terrorist groups
outrageous aspect organization doesn ' target france
would france react location began series contacts organization order play role resolving standoff basque separatists
whatever international community rewards  encourage increase
organization gets diplomatic engagement without forswearing terrorism location 's destruction  would motivate abandon positions
regardless kouchner claims  organization isn ' engaged border dispute location  existential struggle israelis  prove every time missile lands location ashkelon
least organization recognizes location 's right exist
given revelation  likelihood us already knew diplomatic engagements location organization  bush speech appears quite obviously reference without explicitly embarrassing france
let 's go back speech ( via anchoress )  kouchner 's statement  french seem likely reference disputed section bush 's rejection appeasement  barack obama democrats
unless changed positions lately  democrats never publicly suggested us cut ties location  certainly heard voices europe suggesting year  location
appeasers ones talking terrorists see moderate get still demanding destruction location using terrorism civilians strengthen political hand
person wants volunteer cast lot kouchner  's decision looks pretty obvious neither media paid attention speech situation organization
obama threw bus wasn ' rolling direction
