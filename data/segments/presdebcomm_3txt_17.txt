obama  zero  said last debate 'll repeat  person  exempt small businesses requirement large businesses afford provide health care employees
exempt small businesses pay kitty
large businesses afford  've got choice
either provide health insurance employees somebody
right  happens employees get dumped either medicaid system  taxpayers pick  're going emergency room uncompensated care  everybody picks premiums
average family paying additional $ number year higher premiums uninsured
's
exempt small businesses

' health insurance want buy group plan  able buy plan described
haven ' talked senator person 's plan

go buy insurance
's problem - - number million people  may find longer employer-based health insurance

older folks  less healthy folks  's going end happening 're going ones left employer-based system  employers won ' able afford

've got $ number 's going cost $ number 's loss
last point senator person 's plan insurers right  main restrictions primarily state law  senator person 's plan  rules would stripped away would start seeing lot insurance companies cherry-picking excluding people coverage
think  mistake think fundamental difference campaign would approach health care
schieffer

schieffer  right
short response
obama  briefly
heard plan
've got employer-based health care plan  keep
senator person 's plan strong risk people would lose employer-based health care
's choice 'll employer longer provide health care
' take word
us chamber commerce  generally doesn ' support lot democrats  said plan could lead unraveling employer-based health care system
want  've already got health care  lower costs
includes  person
schieffer  right
let 's stop go another question
one goes senator person
senator person  believe roe person person overturned
senator person  believe shouldn '
could either ever nominate someone supreme court disagrees issue
senator person
mccain  would never never years 've imposed litmus test nominee court
's appropriate
schieffer  ' want roe v wade overturned
mccain  thought bad decision
think lot decisions bad
think decisions rest hands states
'm federalist
believe strongly nominees location location supreme court based qualifications rather litmus test
let say time years ago location location senate blow
republicans wanted majority vote confirm judge democrats blocking unprecedented fashion
got together seven republicans  seven democrats
offered chance join
chose afraid appointment  quote  `` conservative judges  ``
voted justice breyer person person
agreed ideology  thought qualified elections consequences presidents nominated
important issue 're talking
senator person voted justice breyer person person grounds didn ' meet ideological standards
's way judge nominees
elections consequences
judged qualifications
's
find best people world - - location location america history strict adherence constitution
legislating bench
schieffer  even someone - - even someone history abortion rights  would consider
mccain  would consider anyone qualifications
believe someone supported roe person person would part qualifications
certainly would impose litmus test
schieffer  right
obama  well  think 's true shouldn ' apply strict litmus test important thing judge capacity provide fairness justice american people
true going  think  one consequential decisions next president
likely one us making least one probably one appointments roe versus wade probably hangs balance
would provide litmus test
somebody believes roe versus wade rightly decided
think abortion difficult issue moral issue one think good people sides disagree
ultimately believe women consultation families  doctors  religious advisers  best position make decision
think constitution right privacy shouldn ' subject state referendum  first amendment rights subject state referendum  many rights subject popular vote
obama  going important issue
look judges outstanding judicial record  intellect  hopefully sense real-world folks going
'll give one quick example
senator person disagreed recently supreme court made difficult woman named lilly ledbetter press claim pay discrimination
years  getting paid less man paid exact job
brought suit  saying equal pay equal work  judges said  well  know  's taken long bring lawsuit  even though didn ' know fairly recently
tried overturn senate
supported effort provide better guidance courts ; person person opposed
think 's important judges understand woman trying raise family  trying support family  treated unfairly  court stand  nobody else
's kind judge want
schieffer  time 's
mccain  obviously  law waived statute limitations  could gone back number number years
trial lawyer 's dream
let talk important aspect issue
change culture location
us proudly pro-life understand
's got courage compassion show young woman 's facing terribly difficult decision
senator person  member location state senate  voted judiciary committee law would provide immediate medical attention child born failed abortion
voted
floor state senate  number times state senator  voted present
another bill senate judiciary committee state location long ago  voted ban partial-birth abortion  one late-term abortion  really - - one bad procedures  terrible
floor location state senate  voted present
' know vote `` present ``
' know align extreme aspect pro - abortion movement location
's record  's matter record
'll say something roe person person  location state senate
clear-cut votes senator person voted  think  direct contradiction feelings views mainstream america
schieffer  response
obama  yes  let respond
sounds incredible would vote withhold lifesaving treatment infant  's 's true
- - facts
bill put forward location senate said provide lifesaving treatment would helped undermine roe person person
fact already law books location required providing lifesaving treatment  pro-choice republicans democrats voted
location medical society  organization doctors location  voted
hippocratic oath would required provide care  already law books
respect partial-birth abortion  completely supportive ban late-term abortions  partial-birth otherwise  long 's exception mother 's health life  contain exception
attempted  many past  including constitutional
rejected  's voted present  'm willing support ban late-term abortions long exception
last point want make issue abortion
issue - - look  divides us
ways  may difficult - - reconcile two views
surely common ground believe choice opposed abortion come together say  `` try prevent unintended pregnancies providing appropriate education youth  communicating sexuality sacred engaged cavalier activity  providing options adoption  helping single mothers want choose keep baby  ``
things put democratic platform first time year  think 's find common ground  nobody 's pro-abortion
think 's always tragic situation
obama  try reduce circumstances
schieffer  let 's give senator person short response
