oh well
quick skim report reveals nothing way serious description `` win `` would look like  let alone concrete plan turn debacle `` win  ``
deals mostly vague efforts strengthen interagency planning us
needless say  something cop-out
always case interagency planning strengthened
also eliminate waste government programs love mother father
report two meta-meanings
first  military prepared  pretty high level acknowledge publicly bush/iraq war `` major debacle  ``
certainly important news ( war debacle  military admit baldly )
secondly  even  one upper echelons establishment ( occasional exception immediately derided mainstream ) brave enough speak full truth americans realized long time ago  bush/iraq war  standard care mention  unwinnable  never fought
question
well yes  strengthen interagency planning remember call moms  neither turn debacle success
years said serious plan confront catastrophe created bush 's utterly immoral invasion  conquest  occupation location must acknowledge unavoidable step one  bush must leave office sensible president location location must elected
short nothing anyone wait
realize horrible plan  much better strengthening interagency planning
organization organization honest pretending anything done hope mitigating disaster
competent  reality-based president installed  hopefully january  number  discuss next step  namely us withdrawal
let 's applaud fact people like person prepared call bush/iraq major debacle  let 's try hide fact establishment discourse still overwhelmed pie-in-the-sky  hope-trumps-experience magical thinking
let 's hide fact nothing whatsoever propose chance improving situation location bush white house 's president connection consensual reality
