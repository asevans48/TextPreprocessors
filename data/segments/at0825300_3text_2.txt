oh dear
scandal
certainly nothing warranted particular headline lede front-page article one last remaining respectable major national newspapers
seems story editor location post wanted run particular headline  regardless direction facts took
hate break newspaper  location half size continental location location

article also tells us  many times invitations extended governor person groups organizations across state ( let alone across country ) specifically requested presence family - fact makes person 's husband children eligible reimbursement
per diem  home number miles away conduct official business  even 's staging area  reimbursement appropriate
unlike senators person person person person  governor on-the-job number hours day
arguably  especially considering distance  would bounds state provided separate budget running satellite governor 's office home
anyone location doesn ' like arrangements  change applicable state law  place since long person became governor
