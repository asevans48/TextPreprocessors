already know location vast energy reserves oil natural gas locked away places congress dares go like arctic national wildlife refuge  instance
also lot snow ice  turns  energy reserves well
crystals known hydrates buried permafrost north slope may contain enough energy heat number million homes decade  extracted properly  hydrates extracted  could provide another boom location 's energy industry
pending natural-gas pipeline could transport output hydrates would conventional natural gas
fact  location may take back seat gulf location  also large amount hydrates cold-water regions already natural-gas infrastructure transport final product
hydrates aren ' quite ready yet  however
government partnered oil companies develop extraction processes  yet test
researchers manufacture synthetic hydrates testing order avoid highly potent natural hydrates  volume number times powerful natural gas
producers location would prefer go conventional natural-gas deposits first  environmentalists worry effect mining permafrost well release methane ( greenhouse gas ) atmosphere
seems similar oil shale natural-gas context
know decades energy potential  locked formations ' quite access costlier resources already hand
's worth researching  afford go slow long continue access conventional deposits know exist already
