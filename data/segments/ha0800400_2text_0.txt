person wins new organization huck beats location
think
person beats mitt nh  location won ' matter terribly much anyone except person
'll remain viable
takes  's good news fred  'll give mitt  huck  maverick one primary headed location location strong momentum anyone
person surprises takes  'll won two states row surging hugely
huck takes  person 's badly hurt since numbers state single digits one 's counting win  new hampshire bounce notwithstanding
'd go organization beat war drum try stop huck
mitt 's actually leading location  though  another huckabee surprise person family 's front lawn  would crushing  especially followed mitt win new organization
'd taken proof person ' beat two competitive  even coming bounce
point defeated person twice  huck would huge momentum among social cons  'd finally look serious enough pick key evangelical endorsements ( person 's maybe ) go location location expecting leverage state 's evangelical base finish mitt fred
's far-fetched ; already leads
pulls  's location nothing way except person
's within seven points state writing  doesn ' take account location win
starting next week  hard calculations drop
person loses new organization  might follow fred 's lead try linger location location pride
person money linger big tuesday february number
stick around split votes among  better positioned huck
instance  nightmare scenario holds  'll mitt fred possibly even person competing social con votes organization numberth
number % anti-huckabee conservatives break
number %  maybe  maverick 's stalwart war support  number % fred 's true conservatism  number % mitt inundated many romney ads 've given resisting
number % go huck
think carefully whether fred ( mitt person ) staying good move  whatever sentimental inclinations may contrary
time pick consensus anti-huck candidate could arrive early evening numberth  location results come
choose wisely
exit question  unless huck fails win another primary location  isn ' big winner last night person
's going second look rudy !
major way huckamania rolls late january
expect see lots terror talk next three weeks try unite anti-huck conservatives banner keeping guy wants apply golden rule location far  far away levers power
update  counterargument  guess  conservatives would much rather take chances location location well funded person person  even mitt suffer two meaningful losses huckabee
think media afterglow person following win new organization would worth ads mitt would run undo media gloom following loss huck location  see way
long short huck wins location location rudy becomes conservatives ' last stand matter wins new hampshire
update  barring sort three-way split among early primaries described  way fred win organization two-man race  various parts true conservative base might coalesce behind
otherwise get split huck 's still  evangelicals go huck mitt 's still social cons wooed advertising
's scenario point two-man race happens  though
guy could knocked everyone else organization person  even  really think fred going beat moneybags coming two three primary wins
update  reader land person notes person may nearly far behind location thought
one ( sketchy ) poll december  democrats independents included  actually led
think fact remains  though  could walk away location loss much easily person could  family pedigree person 's led state long possible narrative coming would crash burn
person 's narrative would late surge fell little short
update  person person says person 's doomed february number come may
enough money organization compete big boys supposedly also mitt going win location  recall
nightmare scenario  person fred long gone big tuesday person hobbled string primary losses ( unless surprises location )
rudy 's ground game really good
really evangelicals big tuesday states matter
