hillary clinton today tied fortunes rest us losing
speaking location rally  presidential contender told faithful economic issues would primary factor number elections
long made people miserable  absent intervening circumstances
like prosperity  employment  security
sounds like hillary version hope change presidential race
specifically  hope economy changes worse
us hope avoid downturn economy
's many us want congress act keep tax rates increasing number making bush tax cuts permanent
want congress start reducing federal spending start working entitlement reforms inevitable meltdown
unfortunately  democratic candidates proposed hundreds billions new spending tax increases
maybe hillary take hint language
biggest worry economy comes literally intervening kind intervening done politicians trying enforce equal outcomes rather provide equal opportunities
least  'd hope would rooting success  rather hoping get lucky ride recession power
