misc parliament pass withdrawal agreement mandating end us military presence location end number  person person notes sunnis extracted price support
number members parliament  number attended number voted favor
means barely passed point view absolute majority  though clear simple majority
apparently person government bowed sunni arab demands agreement submitted national referendum  california-style
true  possible could still rejected misc people
person got parliament painting opponents implicitly opposing us withdrawal  campaign tactic may work general public
think tactic likely work skittish politicians misc public wants occupying forces  knows vote agreement forces would leave immediately
sunnis demanded concessions shiite government exchange votes  including release political prisoners end shiite suppression minority  promises get predictably reneged  would threaten referendum 's passage well
however  interesting shiites  sunnis  kurds  politicians throughout parliament  every individual misc chance weigh security agreement location location  yet basically one `` decider `` country allowed
however  shining city hill  balances things
