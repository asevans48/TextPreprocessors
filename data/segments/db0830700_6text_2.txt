boy  part committee word `` honest ``  isn '
one `` problems `` actually solution  smart nonpartisan solution would simple implement would eliminate lot unnecessary labor
person person asks location nationalize voter registration
solution take job voter registration federal elections hands third parties ( hands counties states ) give federal government
constitution grants congress wide authority congressional elections
next president propose legislation census bureau  conducts number census  also register eligible voters wish registered future federal elections
high-school seniors could signed well would registered vote numberth birthday
people submit change-of-address cards post office  election officials would also change registration information
change would eliminate voter registration fraud
government employees would incentive pad registration lists additional people order keep jobs
system would also eliminate need matches state databases  problem proved troublesome bad quality data
federal government could assign person unique voter-identification number  would remain regardless voter moves
unique id would prevent people voting two jurisdictions  snowbirds might tempted vote location location location

's something democrats republicans
democrats talk wanting expand franchise  's better way way mature democracies  government register voters
republicans serious ballot integrity  winner well
acorn registration drives  concerns democratic secretaries state aggressively matching voters enough motor vehicle databases
finally  universal voter registration good country  make easier wish vote  end controversy ballot integrity threatens undermine legitimacy election process
president person person makes priority  system ready time president 's re-election
course  republicans aren ' serious ballot integrity  opposition would prove
want something carp undermine confidence elections
addition  's credible concern  given current government politicized department justice general services administration  giving voter registration might dangerous consequences
course  republican secretaries state politicization right
wouldn ' nice create election system people ' turn form remember vote old precinct missed cutoff  system designed make voting easier instead harder
one possible innovation elections ( like expanding early voting access  making election day weekend holiday  instant runoff voting  mandate paper ballots  abolishing electoral college  etc
etc  )
certainly would help defuse massive hissy fit hear every four years like clockwork
'd love see republicans oppose concept registering every american vote
