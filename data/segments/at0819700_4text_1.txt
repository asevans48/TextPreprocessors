's person 's opening paragraph op-ed yesterday ( 'm certain going large part speech location today )  call prime minister person person person timetable removal misc troops location presents enormous opportunity
seize moment begin phased redeployment combat troops long advocated  needed long-term success location security interests location location
's organization reporting real quote person  audio recording remarks  heard organization  prime minister use word `` withdrawal ``
actually said  `` direction towards either memorandum understanding evacuation  memorandum understanding programming presence  ``
translation mistake  organization says occurred written copy person 's statement handed reporters  huge
person wasn ' saying sole item left decide pace us withdrawals  merely staking location 's negotiation parameters
many articles subsequently written  based mistaken translation  prime minister 's newfound desire negotiate come agreement withdrawal forces - - essentially switch person 's position - - going help democratic candidate fall election
think even remember poll conducted much would help person  although ' life remember saw
organization goes say misc government knows although military getting better fast  aren ' ready handle security situation - prime minister knows
also  bbc notes terrorists location probably waiting location location leave  launch effective attacks country
' translated '  means combined forces targets eliminate reasonable expectation long-term security achieved
words  work location isn ' done yet
noting person person going visiting location soon  organization helpfully closes article message person person traveling companions senators person person person person ( also opposed surge location  stated was/is military solution situation )  mr obama visits location  expected later month  unlikely find misc government quite set demanding deadlines us withdrawal would like think
fact organization alerted us `` translation mistake `` leads believe article preemptive - organization scared mistake noted elsewhere  wouldn ' able contain damage
think 's probably story - perhaps someone prime minister 's press office intended send different message person 's  ' benefit ' western audiences
' speak read arabic  ' follow suspicions  hope someone else
' wait see  hear  read coming avalanche corrections drive-by media 's undoubtedly going triggered translation revelation  'm even interested person 's
wonder 's going mention speech location today
nb
'd like see person person 's positioning location shattered even  two great pieces yesterday weekly standard 's website
first  accelerated withdrawal
bill roggio long war journal  reminds us recent headlines bush administration pushing accelerated withdrawal location true
administration following  fact  timetable general person told congress last september ( complete slide show slower members congress media ! )
- - timetable based solely upon security conditions ground
two things think particular post
first  isn ' sad drive-by media ' even accurately recall person told congress nine months ago
second  isn ' amazing way back september number  general person confident enough turn-around location brought surge willing go limb publicly recommend plan
piece  `` war 're - - person 's disturbing op-ed `` person person  also found weekly standard 's website
person offers person history lesson location surrounding region  something candidate sorely needs  person needs look map history book
location long today remains one two naturally dominant powers location gulf region  home second-largest proven oil reserves planet front-line bulwark revolutionary location
's story began  person 's hussein 's ambitions hegemony long bloody war location
pity  person person famously quipped  sides conflict couldn ' lose
neither location location rest world could oblivious outcome ; strategic stakes great
obama also listen person  recognized `` location capital caliphate `` aspires recreate  ``
important serious issue today whole world third world war  crusader-zionist coalition began islamic nation  `` declared number  ``
raging land two rivers
world 's millstone pillar location  capital caliphate  ``
person person clear grasp inherent balance power islamic world ; would preferred rule location kabul
doesn ' appear location  either historically contemporaneously  much `` distraction `` obama hopes
