pickens  problem working democrats
little problem working republicans
' like want drill
somehow gotten  lot  drill way
'
's enough oil
watch  pickens made clear  despite five straight weeks calls energy strategy  congressional conservatives interested little besides drilling
fact  last week  house passed energy bill included conservatives ' demand offshore drilling  house republicans opposed would repealed big oil tax breaks invest renewable energy
apparently republican ears  sounds like drill baby drill
