get tour cockpit bring guns onto airplane !
love stories like 'm flights
'll blame person person noticing fact one bothered check imposter 's badge follow procedures  took imposter 's word pointing air marshals letting cockpit two flights  person grant faces charges impersonating federal agent  could bring three years prison
person claims already paid fine resolve violation  apparently federal prosecutors record settlement  least federal level  would jurisdiction
grant claims mixup  record instance  's reliable sources
time  organization fire everyone handled grant short one agent location location smelled something fishy
grant show badge fill form  everyone believed authorized dhs travel armed
procedures specify dhs traveling armed letter specifically authorizing agent carry weapon  yet one vetted grant required produce authorization  even look closely badge
jules reminds us two four number/number flights originated logan airport
one might expect tsa agents take security wee bit seriously  considering
many people get board flights packing flashing badges one inspects
hearing two years happened
