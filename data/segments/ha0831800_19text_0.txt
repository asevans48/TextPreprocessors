location spent last two years demanding unconditional  direct talks us negotiating pursuit nuclear power/weapons
us elected president agreed terms  location changed mind
claim differences two nations great unconditional talks  thus dies another bush derangement syndrome fallacy
critics current administration abroad blamed bush normal relations iranians
truth  europeans didn ' ' want us direct negotiations iranians yet  would reduce leverage location trading partners
iranians never wanted direct talks ; hate us location aren ' interested buddies
point person allies never seem understand
people hate us  policies trade security
location nation run radical islamist mullahs see secular democracy enemy religion  western values temporary heresy plan correct global caliphate misc control
irans ' mullahs see location bastion values  location outpost region
location mostly irrelevant ; deal europe eliminating arsenal democracy  hobbling badly longer make difference
's person person holds symposiums world without us location
addendum  iranians also claimed tested long-range missile yesterday  apparently one else saw  two-stage rocket launch hardly secret  especially misc person person
one confirm  probably didn ' happen
