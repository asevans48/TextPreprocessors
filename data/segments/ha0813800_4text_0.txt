earlier week  management naral pro-choice america decided publicly endorse person person president  touched firestorm criticism within ranks
many members saw betrayal hillary person  engaged naral decades  others wondered stupidity taking sides finish line sight
provided object lesson advocacy groups timing engaging electoral process  course  loss support naral would give heartache  oppose agenda entirely
certainly going support eventual democratic nominee anyway  regardless candidate prevailed
still  incompetence drove decision seems striking enough closer review
first  advocacy groups avoid primary fights case  especially one closely associated one particular party naral
little doubt proclaimed democratic candidates race would supported naral 's platform entirety  organization really dog fight one gets nominated
less true  advocacy organizations usually get involved much earlier process  looking candidate closely matches policies  taxation  energy  national security  labor  world hunger
naral picked worst time make endorsement
instead picking someone early  chose person three weeks left go end primaries
think could help location location  believe danger losing nomination
practical effect would endorsement ability collect votes handful contests remaining
much  obviously wasn ' motivation
wanted send message hillary get race  rather ride short string primaries left
naral wants show muscle party 's operations  doesn ' mind throwing hillary bus
instead  enraged base women seen hillary champion race mission naral see opponent obama-come-lately  ally certainly someone done trench work hillary done long period years
endorsements timing
like person person ' endorsement person  came week edwards ' state went polls  naral waited far late real effect race  early kneecap politically
may gained nominal influence person  lost lot ground membership  may start looking intelligent leadership future
