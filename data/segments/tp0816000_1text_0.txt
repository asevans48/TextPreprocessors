person  person 's policies would absolutely ' extension ' enhancement ' bush 's widely-ridiculed speech last tuesday  sen
person person ( r-az ) noted person hear opponent 's campaign every speech  every interview  every press release 'm running president person 's third term
hear every policy president described bush-mccain policy
added believes comparisons false
seems sen
person person ( r-sc )  person 's chief surrogate attack dog  disagrees
today abc 's week  person stated unequivocally person 's tax health care policies extension bush 's polices also enhancement  stephanopoulos  let bring senator person back brought two
said tax policy health care policy essentially  senator person  person person calling extension maybe enhancement bush policies
person  yeah  absolutely
watch  person 's speech last week represented feeble attempt distance bush  something top surrogate acknowledges futile
strangely enough  mccain economic adviser person person said recently person 's economic polices  person 's  would represent third bush term ( claim ultra-conservative person person even found absurd )
simple fact person right
person proposing massive tax cuts primarily benefit higher-income households  ignore priorities drive national debt trillions
person 's health care policy would raise costs abandon uninsured
sure sounds like extension enhancement bush 's policies
