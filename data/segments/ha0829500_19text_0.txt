're certainly going try
yesterday  organization launched new website lists donors gave less $ number since person person officially became gop nominee president  ended fundraising accept public financing
person  reneged promise use public financing  refuses release donor information donations level
abc 's jake tapper takes notice  really good reason reveal donors
organization website middle presidential campaign  person campaign certainly well
want admit certain amount incompetence basic data management undermine tech-savvy patina  especially shooting foot making fun person person 's inability use e-mail
think
politico 's person person offers one possible explanation  doesn ' make much sense
organization 's site lists first last name amount donation  contact information
won ' help candidates building donor list
besides  isn ' party leader supposed help candidates
looks like team person doesn ' want people perusing massive numbers donors names like qwerty poiuy  asdfgh lkjh ' ;  zxcvb mnnumber states location  organization  qw
much openness transparency
