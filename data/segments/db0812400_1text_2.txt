's colonial war like vietnam  wwii
one main forces behind normalizing relations vietnam past decade  person must know stayed would violent still
colonialism left awful mark country terrible fallout us left  staying wouldn ' helped matters  would made worse
staying location make worse
maybe time  little bit better normalize relations country reasonable amount time leave flames
truth make mistake like made vietnam location  leave

self respecting native allow invader occupy land indefinitely
`` liberation `` fantasy exposed  idea permanent military presence longer operative
republicans allowed shift argument
