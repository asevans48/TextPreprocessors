recounting recountby digbyi ' know last night watching recount  nightmares
nightmares screaming television number days shameful spin bush people
nightmares watching purely political power game lay bare rickety foundations democracy
nightmares person person stupid goddamned tote board
certainly brought back memories
'm sure true watched real time  obvious moment gore retracted concession republican establishment bush location machine levers power work battle like
wasn ' obvious would use blatantly  media egging endless hand wringing `` uncertainly `` weakening fabric country
like democrats movie  completely dismissed idea us supreme court  put test  would end final enforcer republican party
( would say last naivete died - - - would wrong
little reveals death throes every single day
seems idealism ran deeply thought  )
interesting movie see bushies avoided appearances collusion person person 's office
little detail  wrote  watched movie last night might enjoy reading  seems every day hear another example bush administration politicizing justice department
today hear former career prosecutor civil rights division  filling another piece puzzle  spent number years department enforcing federal civil rights laws particularly voting rights
leaving number  worked attorneys general dramatically different political philosophies person person person person person person
regardless administration  political appointees respect experience judgment longtime civil servants
bush administration  however  changed
last six years  justice department ignored advice staff skewed aspects law enforcement ways clearly intended influence outcome elections
notably shirked legal responsibility protect voting rights
number number  voting discrimination cases brought behalf african american native misc voters
us attorneys told instead give priority voter fraud cases   coupled strong support voter id laws  indicated intent depress voter turnout minority poor communities
's another article debunking `` voter fraud `` trope
surprise
surprise nobody seems seen coming
rough outlines available wrote saw emerging `` illegal aliens voting `` theme almost year ago
thought preparing use last november premature anti-purger
since first started writing on-line  one recurring themes modern republican party become fundamentally hostile democracy
( already knew crooks  )
first made obvious back number  republican leader person person famously stated `` president important us  ``
went impeach president clear people
biggest clue came number location recount
know seems like ancient history go back extremely important remember outrageous tactics  person campaign used legal tactics bush campaign didn '
`` bourgeois riot `` dirty trickster roger stone directing street theatre van
( 's list village voice termed five worst bush recount outrages  )
used every lever power could count illegally cast overseas ballots
operated hypocritical situational media campaign press completely failed properly analyze late
helpfully told objected `` get  ``
guess
republicans remarkably good keeping mouths shut location location  pretending person person 's electoral apparatus gave unusual help
still  surprised see former location recount icon show lehrer news hour last week argue us attorney firings completely board
name person person lawyer argued bush case location supreme court
's picture
'm sure many remember  newshour failed identify one location recount team instead named merely former person official
didn ' fail carry bush water one time  person person  really think much ado little
'm saying haven ' mishandled public relations perspective
clearly
notion firing eight us attorneys white house personnel involved somehow shocking like saying 're shocked discover 's gambling casablanca
' know people
's one member judiciary committee hasn ' called white house justice department said  `` cousin law school roommate wants us attorney  ``
notion kinds appointments removals person 's administration - - fired number one slot - - notion isn ' influenced fact president needs team place  main justice department field  really quite silly quite counterfactual
would typical person
instance  's something said bush v person decided  new deadline recounts submitted person person number pm sunday  november number
sunday afternoon could watch television coverage see location location still counting
late afternoon heard various officials location location acknowledging going finished five
maintain completely illegal  law said manually recount ballots
[ see village voice top five outrages slimy position take  ]
person person person approached  heard secretary state going accept location location partial recount - - - even though location location partial recount blatantly illegal
told secretary state 's view unless location location actually informed - - - writing otherwise - - - returns partial recount  could infer
made calls republicans overseeing location location recount
told gently suggest canvassing board might well put partial return front returns faxed time deadline
reason gave clarity - - - words partial return would distinguish returns full count would coming later night
'm exactly sure happened  think location location board end write partial recount returns
know secretary state  end  rejected
[ rejecting  means said partial return missed deadline altogether previously uncounted votes counted partial recount never added tally
effect never allowing person take lead  ]
think board members probably agreed write partial recount notation two reasons
first  think hadn ' slept number hours  think 'd sort anything
second  ' think anybody else would suspected would actually make difference
would imagine without simple notation partial return partial count would accepted complete count secretary state
even television showed still counting
' think machiavellian suggest board write partial recount
think would sort machiavellian suggest pretend partial returns
[ talk magazine  march number  p number ] know virtually nobody cares anymore  ever  full nonsense amazed got away saying
tale tells  bad  still obviously whole story
clearly colluding person person ' office throughout determined could reject location location county votes counted numberpm little gambit
everything depended allowing al gore ever take lead whole pr campaign would start fall apart
's small thing  know  probably one thousands small acts illegal inappropriate collusion person person campaign recount
happened knew happened
done people like person person  former person justice department official implies us attorney scandal nothing everyone knows bush justice department enforcement arm republican party 's perfectly normal
people think
's hunted clinton reno like dogs eight years  determined find evidence wrongdoing
either assume everyone know innoculate accusations bad acts getting punch first
( harrassing democrats rewarding  )
wrote reporters person person jake tapper carvin tid-bit covering media recount ny times salon ( tapper writing book  )
tapper uninterested  person person called told find quote
( talk person lexis-nexis  )
came number/number  recount story pretty much shelved entire country told gather around president
told beginning  hadn '
media complicit  helping republicans along every step way recount constant rending garments constitutional crisis fantasies tanks streets things weren ' settled instantly
( deadlines !
god  deadlines ! )
done  told us repeatedly get
six years later  actually debating whether bush white house manipulating electoral system
god 's sake - - - course
administration installed crude manipulation rigged levers power bush family 's political machine see outrageous conduct perfectly legitimate
indeed  'm sure believe `` 's machiavellian `` use department justice rig vote - - - person would machiavellian
update  's nice little update number bourgeois rioters
update ii  lest forget  person person  person person insisted replace arkansas us attorney location recount team
person person
's pretty think ancient history move
maybe
week  person person hired run rncs person opposition research team
voter fraud apparatus person others built  includes republican lawyers like carvin griffin  still running
maybe spent useless
hope
