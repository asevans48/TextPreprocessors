disagree
'm actually picking argument comment made sense others
although right saying parent gives certain lessons child 's important child different influences  lessons come people gender
different parents going different matter gender
nurturing doesn ' necessarily come mother discipline father
also  say parents men  children aren ' going secluded women life
aunts  grandmothers  teachers  family friends  etc serve role models examples
also  regardless whether arguments make sense  simply isn ' shown studies done children raised gay parents
