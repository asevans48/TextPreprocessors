legitimate change come primaryby ddayi want thank senator edwards running tremendous campaign
moved policy progressive direction matured far number
two juggernauts couldn ' wedge media spotlight
( media  way  picked nominees
)
dismissive location 's moving primary  've taken lot heat calitics
edwards dropping last night 's events  think  prove two things
change primary system
number-number % voters whittle field two candidates  deliver nominee republican side  serious problem everyone knows
degradation location moving focus process  animus location
process sucks
needs reformed big way
fact location broke rules  moved  delivered delegates dem side  obviously succeeded since picked republican nominee  tell something
need spread-out process maybe earlier conventions end bad front-loaded system
's terrible democracy
instant runoff voting
many democrats threw vote away voting early edwards  candidates dropped election states
're moving toward model election day election month  primaries candidates drop  voters disenfranchised
extent voters remorse  vote go second choice  would completely simple used person
second choice ' fill bubbles
prefer media-driven candidates foisted bulk country  go ahead keep wonderful primary train going !
maybe within cycles vote nominee nominee four years hence day !
'd make things much easier
