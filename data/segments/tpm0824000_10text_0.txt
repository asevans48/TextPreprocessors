new mccain ad released morning attacking person location rips person 's words context egregiously amounts distortion best outright smear worst
ad 's narrator says  `` person says location ' tiny ' country
' doesn ' pose serious threat  '
terrorism
destroying location
aren ' serious threats  ``
quote person supposedly said location `` doesn ' pose serious threat `` delivered may number  number  according date flashed ad
juxtaposing truncated quote `` terrorism `` `` destroying location  `` ad badly distorts person actually said day  broadly  also distorts person 's position location
full may numberth obama quote  supplied person press release  `` strong countries strong presidents talk adversaries
's person person
's reagan person
's nixon person
mean think
location  location  location - - countries tiny compared location location
' pose serious threat us way soviet union posed threat us
yet willing talk soviet union time saying 're going wipe planet  ``
clearly  person didn ' say location doesn ' pose serious threat
rather  clearly said location doesn ' pose serious threat us way soviet union posed threat us
's  person didn ' simply say location `` tiny  `` ad suggests  clear effort hoodwink viewers thinking person sees location threat
rather  said tiny compared location location
serious distortions also odds person 's actual positions location
person said location threat location
instance  june number  speech aipac  person said  `` greater threat location - - peace stability region - - location  ``
person also clearly said location threat sense 's liked terrorism  despite ad 's suggestion person doesn ' see terror threat
june numberth aipac speech  person said location  `` support terrorism threats toward location increased  ``
nothing like bracing dose lies get day good start  huh
