morning  unknown attackers bombed times square military recruitment office
thankfully  office building housed closed time attack  person person wrote escalating attacks military recruiters week ago
lists several cities recruitment centers attacked varying degrees  usually limited vandalism threats violence
operations hurt military recruiting
person wrote two years ago ( many times since )  quite obviously attackers grown frustrated haven ' frightened enough people slow flow recruits
movement decided morph domestic terrorism
course  people responsible claim bombed office night keep anyone hurt
's exactly kind rationalization people like weather underground sla used first  anyway terrorism justified politics
fact  like person person person person still claim
exactly politics behind

people joining military volunteer
code pink protesters throw paint  rocks  unknown terrorists throw bombs want disarm nation 's attack radical jihadists  time want stop young men women exercising choices
since code pink contingent nutcases throw bombs ' possibly win democratic process  want engage intimidation terrorism frighten people acquiescence
