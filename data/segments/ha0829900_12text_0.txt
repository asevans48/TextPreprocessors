read different blogs get different perspectives keep arguments left  usually sites mix contributors like aol 's political machine
person person blogs reports site  disagree strenuously tommy  's good writer almost always worth read
yesterday  tommy wrote interesting defense progressive tax system threw snark elitism shows misunderstanding concept  first  let 's tackle defense progressive tax system
tommy claims federal government somehow benefits wealthy working class
'm certain news
extent one calculate direct benefits costs  cost burden already falls almost entirely higher earners
top number % pay number % income taxes received government  top number % earners pay number %
bottom number % earners country pay less number % income tax collected federal government
direct benefits government apply pay less   top earners ' get direct return investment
ah  tommy argues federal government protects rich  therefore 's right pay
manner government protects rich protect us defending private-property rights  defending borders  establishing rule law
neutral income level individual citizens us
progressive tax system  meaning one rates increase level earned
flat-rate system would still ensure rich pay terms gross dollar ensuring everyone pay percentage income earned
progressives ' like  though  want government determine winners losers rather allowing talents work individuals free market determine
note 'm talking government spending ( various programs support lower-income families )  manner government collects income
progressive tax system serves two purposes
first  punishes succeed
second  minimizes negative impact redistribution people ' object
flat-rate tax could raise much money  redistribution would become obvious unpopular
's person person plumber 's objection resonates
person person wants government determine excessive wealth confiscate government spread wealth better individuals earned
fact  elitist  tommy doesn ' understand
plumber elitist thinks people ' make decisions need small  select group people make decisions
elitism doesn ' refer people sun yachts location  governing philosophy assumes people ' run lives require others make decisions
basic question person person plumber comes spend money people earn
answer given government  's elitist answer
answer given earner  misc  free-market answer supports self-government private-property ownership
fact  also supports common sense
filter wealth huge bureaucracy person person plumber spread wealth additional cost  choosing winners losers instead elites location
update  added paragraph clarity
