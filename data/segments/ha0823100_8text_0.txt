bill donohue catholic league protested choice bloggers democratic convention location
despite list bloggers public almost three months  person suddenly discovered democratic bloggers explicit hostility catholic church  extremists
person wants dncc disinvite week go start party denver  maybe dncc ask donohue took long research
plain silly  typical overreaction person
person wants one blogger banned criticized pope 's clothes  commenters rude
's even petty original criticism
daily kos  one imagine democratic party telling person person person take hike
uh sure
number blogs  three person finds objectionable
'd call remarkable
donohue  'd focus candidate convention nominate  rather bloggers report
besides  worst thing democrats could person would accommodate demand
hostility democrats display pro-life activists catholics  better american people truly assess party represents
