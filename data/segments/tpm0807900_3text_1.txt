would matter
much would new primary help close delegate gap
answer  probably much  possibly quite opposite
explain  jump
first  isn ' certain hillary would win contest large margin  would need order put real dent person 's pledged delegate lead
location democratic electorate one-quarter african-american  largest democratic pockets places like misc center detroit  college town location location  working-class location region
assuming person wins detroit person person  hillary wins flint similar areas plus rest state  could make close race
lot information probably gleaned original rogue primary january  hillary won low-level shadow campaign real opponent ballot  `` uncommitted  ``
however  hillary won number % -number % margin  actual candidate complicated effort get people opposed cast protest vote primary count anything
according location democratic party 's claimed delegate totals  spread gave hillary number delegates number uncommitted + number net take hillary delegate slots went person  hypothetical deal seat delegates based january primary would inevitably involve
eighteen pledged dels decent-sized haul  really enough significantly cut person 's edge
revote almost certainly wouldn ' even give large victory
exit polling showed real primary would resulted hillary getting number %  person number %  person person number %
recent person poll showing new primary tied number %  groundwork clearly close contest
let 's look three scenarios new primary  hillary winning different margins assuming delegate proportionality location 's number new delegates across districts  hillary wins number % -number % = hillary + numberhillary wins number % -number % = hillary + numberhillary wins number % -number % = hillary + number first two far likely third
bottom line  's hard imagine hillary netting number delegates  'd likely net good deal less
comes pledged delegates  location revote unlikely alter race 's underlying dynamic meaningful way
