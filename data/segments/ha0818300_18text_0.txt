john poor bmi beers spoke kind enough forward audio
wanted reserve judgment fuller quote transcript ; feel free judge away
expected  point mainly rehash obnoxious times piece arguing  per mccain 's anti-iraq vet colleagues senate  doesn ' grasp difficult war spent vietnam years merely tortured instead combat

clark 's point soldiering  least lower ranks  doesn ' qualify executive experience
fair enough except beers seems think  least far national security concerned  even seems believe soldiering credential long home protesting time

funny works
like 's funny prominent democrats keep challenging person 's hawkishness thumbnail psychoanalyses wartime ordeal 's supposedly left form diminished capacity
wonder subtext
