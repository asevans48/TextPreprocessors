maybe shocker mcclatchy reported
pew research says 's even close
number % person person 's coverage positive  compared whopping number % negative  since debate
person person
three guesses  put another way  person gets treated positively number % often person person  gets treated negatively number % obama
's equal amounts coverage  little surprising
imagine would like coverage imbalanced
organization caveats study
negative coverage mainly comes poll analysis  say  person 's trending downward longer since conventions obama
's true far goes  'm curious whether polls drive coverage drives polling
also  proliferation polls gives media outlets choice narrative
maybe focus worst polls ones indicating dead heat
could explain media outlets ( won ' name names like cbs  course ! )
routinely conduct polls ridiculously-skewed samples favoring democrats number points  drive kind negative coverage
study doesn ' answer basic questions journalistic integrity  pew claims
perhaps couple weeks  compare number stories person person plumber 's political history alliances written topics person see media favored
actually  one needs study answer question
