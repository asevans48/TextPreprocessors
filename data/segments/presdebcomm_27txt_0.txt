recommended congress budget ceiling three hundred ninety-five billion dollar  would permitted us $ number billion tax reduction
tax reduction program middle-income taxpayers  recommended congress increase personal exemptions seven hundred fifty dollar per person one thousand dollar per person
would mean  course  family four family would thousand dollar personal exemption - money could spend purposes  money government wouldn ' spend
keep lid federal spending  think - help congress  justify fully $ number billion tax reduction

within sixty-billion dollar increase would fit programs promised american people
might say  - see goals can not reached - believe 're reasonable goals - would cut back rate implement - implementation new programs order accommodate balanced budget fiscal year ' number last year next term
believe ought balanced budget normal economic circumstances
uh - projections carefully made
stand behind
error slightly side  'll phase programs 've uh - advocated  slowly
ms
drew  governor  uh - according budget committees congress tha - tha - tha - referred  get full employment - project number percent unemployment -  say  even allowing inflation programs  would anything surplus $ number billion end ninet - number
conservative estimates programs would 'd number hundred billion dollar
- say 're going able things balance budget
mr
carter  well  uh - assumption - uh - described different rate growth economy
ms
drew   took account figures
mr
carter  believe 's accurate say - - committees refer - employment uh - state  number number half percent growth rate economy  uh - projections would uh - $ number billion increase amount money 'd spend lnumber compared
uh - uh - framework would befit - improvements programs
include uh - uh - uh extra control uh unnecessary spending  weeding obsolete obsolescent programs
uh - 'll uh - safety version built complete reorganization executive branch government pledged
present bureaucratic structure - federal government mess
'm elected president 's gon na top priority mine completely revise structure federal government  make economical  efficient  purposeful manageable change
also  'm going institute zero-based budgeting used four years location  uh - assesses every program every year  eliminates programs obsolete obsolescent
projections  balanced budget fiscal year number  'm elected president

mr
newman  president person
mr
ford  uh true $ number billion surplus fiscal year number  rather spend money new programs governor carter recommends endorses  included democratic platform  think american taxpayer ought get additional tax break - tax reduction magnitude
feel taxpayers ones need relief  ' think add additional programs magnitude governor carter talks
seems tax structure today rates high
uh - glad point since number  republican administrations  ten million people taken tax rolls lower end taxpayer area
time  assuming sign tax bill mentioned mr
person  last two tax bills increased minimum tax wealthy taxpayers
believe eliminating ten million taxpayers last uh eight years  putting heavier tax burden higher tax brackets  plus actions 've taken uh - give taxpayers adequate tax relief
seems uh - look recommendations budget committees projections  isn ' going $ number billion dividend
've heard dividends past ; always happens
expected one time vietnam war  used ever ended war taxpayers never got adequate relief deserved
mr

person
mr
reynolds  mr
president  came office spoke eloquently need time healing  early administration went location announced  proposed program uh case-by-case pardons draft resisters restore full citizenship
fourteen thousand young men took advantage offer  another ninety thousand
granting pardon former president person  sir  part rationale put watergate behind us - may quote - truly end long national nightmare
rationale apply  today  bicentennial year  young men resisted location  many still exile abroad
mr
ford  amnesty program recommended chicago september number would give draft evaders - uh military deserters opportunity earn uh - good record back
fourteen fifteen thousand take advantage program
gave ample time
- across-the-board pardon draft evaders military deserters
case mr
nixon  reason - pardon given   took office country  divided condition
hatred  divisiveness - uh people lost faith government many  many respects
mr
nixon resigned  became president

mr
nixon resigned
