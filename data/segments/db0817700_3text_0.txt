activities  person emphasized nixon  clearly illegal
nevertheless  president approved plan
five days later  opposition person person person  plan withdrawn  president 's approval later listed articles impeachment alleged abuse presidential power
frost  sense  're saying certain situations  person plan part one  president decide 's best interests nation something  something illegal
nixon  well  president means illegal
frost  definition
nixon  exactly
exactly
president  example  approves something national security  case threat internal peace order significant magnitude  president 's decision instance one enables carry  carry without violating law
otherwise 're impossible position
frost   words  really saying answer  really  burglary murder   's subtle way say murder dissenter country ' know evidence effect
point  dividing line  fact  dividing line president 's judgment
nixon  yes  dividing line  one get impression  president run amok country get away  mind president come electorate
also mind  president get appropriations congress
mind  example  far organization 's covert operations concerned  far organization 's covert operations concerned  years  disclosed  limited basis trusted members congress
' know whether done today
frost  pulling discussions together  ; speaking presidency interrogatory filed church committee  stated  quote  `` 's quite obvious certain inherently government activities   undertaken sovereign protection interests nation 's security lawful  undertaken private persons   ``
root  mind
nixon  well   root mind think perhaps much better stated person war states
person said  think remember quote almost exactly  said  `` actions otherwise would unconstitutional  could become lawful undertaken purpose preserving constitution nation  ``
's kind action 'm referring
course lincoln 's case survival union wartime  's defense nation  knows  perhaps survival nation
frost  comparison  situation faced situation lincoln faced  instance
nixon  nation torn apart ideological way war location  much civil war tore apart nation person president
's true didn ' north southfrost  said  said talking person plan  know  `` president orders  makes legal ``   president senseis anything constitution bill rights suggests president far sovereign  far law
nixon   isn '
's nothing specific constitution contemplates respect
haven ' read every word  every jot every title  know   however  argued far president concerned  war time  president certain extraordinary powers would make acts would otherwise unlawful  lawful undertaken purpose preserving nation constitution  essential rights 're talking
time  considering person plan based legitimate legal doctrine setting forth unlimited power president `` preserve nation `` considered people figment tricky dick 's paranoid fantasies
ridiculous  lunacy  fevered imaginings disgraced somewhat unhinged political figure
sure  everyone knew government things like  particularly various red scares  thought least decency pretend based upon unenumerated royal prerogative
guess know wasn ' true  '
fact  constitutional philosophy believed members nixon 's party number years
manifested location came full fruition torture  imprisonment surveillance regime bush administration
wasn ' fluke
really believed president power anything wanted thing stopping congressional appropriations process
question become mainstream philosophy
would guess spend many decades arguing whether president sovereign powers rather sweeping circumstances used
congress verge legalizing unlimited secret use private corporations spy customers without warrants
already shown complete willingness allow president designate people discretion beyond scope constitution  human rights international law  including right torture
supreme court one vote shy sanctioning generations
way knowing using powers `` preserve nation `` ( days number/number know fact use monitor dissenters  )
presidents undoubtedly tempted use political purposes doctrine  nixon  populace ever becomes vociferous
knows `` preserving nation `` mean next time
whatever doesn ' kill authoritarian beast makes stronger
'll dealing fallout yet another number years
indeed  time may stick forever
