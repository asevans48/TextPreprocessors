couple quick additional points question du jour  whether person person 's bipartisan gestures staff picks suggest betrayal progressives
first  's worth distinguishing two different approaches `` bipartisanship  ``
's one thing person put republicans key posts simply sake making gop party leaders hidebound bipartisanship-worshiping dc opinion-makers happy
's non-starter  amount sops stop gop trying stymie person 's initiatives
person 's `` bipartisanship `` consists trying bring rank file republicans independents mobilizing behind big initiatives  's another matter entirely
ed kilgore calls bipartisanship `` ground  `` effort use `` aggressive  direct stimulation public opinion push members opposing party  especially states districts president popular  come across line  ``
person already signaling latter approach
noted  presser today  person claimed election delivered `` mandate `` simultaneously promising govern republicans
basically  shaping `` bipartisanship ground  ``
person preparing define initiatives reflection bipartisan mandate rallying bipartisan voter support behind
words  person preparing redefine `` center `` supportive withdrawal location  major health care overhaul  real energy reform  etc
devil obviously policy details  's seems headed
's also worth making crucial distinction two different ways critiquing person 's staff picks
first involves looking choices order extrapolate obama 's policy priorities - - somewhat useless exercise  since won ' know policy direction 's headed proposes actual policies  matter appoints
second  valid  way looking staff choices ask whether 're inherently good ideas  regardless suggest possible policy priorities
instance  person person argues persuasively  keeping defense secretary person person inherently bad idea  keeps leadership charge half federal budget  worse  sends message republicans needed manage national security
mode critique doesn ' involve making speculative extrapolations person 's future policy directions  seems like far sensible way look choices
