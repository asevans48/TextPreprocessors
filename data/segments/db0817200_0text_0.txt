sistah soljah 'd
digbythere 's lots blogospheric angst today  good reason  around fisa legislation
senator person 's commitment support `` compromise  `` ( promising `` work `` remove offensive telcom immunity ) big disappointment
tempted say sistah soljah moment  wherein person makes clear villagers one dfh 's  despite ardent support
nothing associated us issue
may even make sense sort abstract level
's obviously decided run right pretty hard counteract `` liberal senator `` label
actually idea motivation rest democrats  seem stuck number time warp  fighting battle location rumsfeld
may genuinely think legislation good afraid republicans use
( ' think 's going help frankly - - - person voted last time 's need scare ads  )
say wins  promises abuse power gives  guess feel good
know  would made `` compromise `` brought floor without ok  probably without direction
leader democratic party  middle hotly contested presidential campaign
didn ' come say get thing done fall  came asked permission
's fact
aren ' going anything doesn ' want
's really capitulation
's strategy
update  person person says person wants power president
may right
would also good reason keep
