first argument compares two things related ; fallacy faulty analogy
ability fabricate aircraft evidence ability raise love child
argument deductively evidence person  gay gay  raise love child
moreover  asserted homosexuals able conceive children
therefore  deduce claim homosexuals biologically deprived necessary organs conception child
lastly  argument ineffective proving thing syllogistically
remainder claims rhetorical questions dont deserve refutation
entirety argument fails prove one thing validly deduced author
final statement  assumption something existentially negative gay
a sentence fragment
subject identified predicate
b affirmed something existentially negative gay ; can not conceive children
whole argument begins irrationality ends irrationality
expect future reply also equally irrational
