civilians unaware tremendous pressure members congress able bring bear military commanders
particular senator congressman doesn ' happen committee subcommittee direct oversight military budgets affairs  bet one cronies
particularly true flag rank navy officers generals services promotions lofty ranks require congressional approval
must guessed going
