plan seeing theatrical release weekend  would recommend everyone least way discuss values limitations scientific inquiry intellectual openness american location
bloggers cpac received invitation screen new documentary academic intolerance called expelled  movie evening
documentary features person person quest understand near-hysteria caused scientists much broach idea intelligent design papers research
follows person interviews professors denied tenure  editors fired  journalists shunned touching subject even innocuous levels
discussing feelings film  still post-production go release april  explain approach id/evolution debate
believe evolution demonstrably proven enough examples say effect variation species can not denied
example used tonight discussing another viewer ( certainly example ) antibiotic effects bacteria
antibiotics kill number % bacteria eventually promote survival expansion number % resist  created superbacteria require another set antibiotics cure
said  evolution interfere faith god
god certainly could created universe design included life
rational laws nature would include evolution  well myriad rational mathematically provable mechanisms undergird nature
fact  impulse man discover rational laws nature began belief rational god  scientists understood nature 's rationality reveal intelligent creator
'd go deeper  person person person covers nicely enough already book 's great christianity  's getting late enough
suffice say evolution doesn ' present threat worldview
rationally  admit use id excuse teach literal form creationism used argue evolution entirely  especially teaching evolution primary-school classrooms
admission appear expelled  glaring omission
tends take context frustration scientists id  place polarizing debate use
properly framed  id accepts science without accepting transformation belief system
mean
film excellent job demonstrating atheism belief system
atheism represented person person others film gets exposed exactly kind belief system claim despise
' prove god exists ' prove god doesn ' exist
make common fallacy arguing absence evidence amounts evidence absence
way  secondary real issue film  academic intolerance
debate id vs darwinism sets table truly disturbing look location
science free debate research ideas hypotheses duplicable results provable theorems
however  examples person film provide amply show  darwinist academic establishment brook dissent orthodoxy scientists shown hidden faces speak issue film
amusingly  person asks people first cell came
none scientists could give straight answer
person admits person doesn ' know one else  either postulates aliens could brought life planet  postulates another alien civilization could brought life planet
concedes one entity could original source insists entity could possibly god
gives absolutely evidence  relegating belief system somewhat akin scientology
extremely effective  many allusions made location wall film
theme runs throughout  explicitly refers defensive academic establishment built wall tramples freedom thought discourse
less effective heavy references nazis movie
although emotionally affecting obvious reasons  fact nazis mostly darwinists ( along lot things )  vast majority darwinists aren ' nazis
certainly eugenicists misc location mightily influenced darwinism  location eugenicists  film points
point film finished production  changes made release april
filmmakers completed interview person person include final cut
believe changes may made could address criticisms 've written
overall  though  film presents powerful argument intelligent design much freedom scientific inquiry
scientists get punished challenging orthodoxy  expand learning ossify concrete
expelled  movie entertaining  maddening  funny  provocative  well worth time
