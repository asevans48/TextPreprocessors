like mr
person  proposes national marketplace dubs health insurance exchange  individuals small businesses could buy coverage  subsidies based income
private insurers new medicare-like public program would compete exchange offer coverage
couple things note
first  mandate coverage - tell every single american must health insurance - must enforcement mechanism people ' get away paying `` fair share  ``
logical entity equipped carry task irs almost certainly empowered seize property - likely tax refund might coming - even send bill due way send bills taxes owed
giving bureaucratic thugs power already stupefyingly bad idea
want national health insurance  literally way
governmental entity equipped act collection agency
besides  duplicate function already performed government agency
secondly  word `` subsidies  ``
nothing journal article floor eligible government pay part premium
plans - including person 's - set floor number % less poverty line
nonsense
necessarily higher - perhaps twice number - order entice people live paycheck paycheck buy system
since chances health insurance plan actually reducing level growth health care costs pretty close zero first several years program  premiums  necessity  rise
premiums go every year  subsidies rise well  floor poorest citizens subsidized raised well
start costing $ number billion skyrocket
also skyrocketing number citizens eligible subsidies
soon  virtually entire health insurance system subsidized one degree another
government putting much health insurance  logically follows going want bigger say divvying health care resources
bet 're paying  going want horn personal decisions made citizens consultation doctors
would end private health care beginning nightmare european countries experiencing pick choose gets care doesn '  lives  dies
stop
optimistic
unless way found show american people future kinds mandated plans  hard row hoe order educate dangers
