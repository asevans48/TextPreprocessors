cq politics column  person person snidely asks  `` guy ( person ) doesn ' know use computer become president  ``
reading column first thought  `` organization educated lawyer doesn ' know elementary school level geography become president  ``
person second  `` organization educated lawyer doesn ' know many states country wants govern become president  ``
considering candidate 's demonstrated disregard finer points geography history  democrats media minions might want think twice poking fun person lack knowledge
personally find far less disturbing person  seventies  little knowledge computers fact supposed young genius forties evidently ignorant basic geography
wager lot senior voters share feeling president perform duties quite well without computer skills
's like asking  `` type  ``
concern folks like us  `` find location map  ``
personal experience internet taught medium  especially liberal side  heavily populated technical whizzes long computer skills short judgment
shallow  words
guess candidate
