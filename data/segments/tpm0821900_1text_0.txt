new time poll - - gives barack obama narrow lead horse race steep deficit national security issues - - line polls
figure easily  every poll 's methodology released internals slightly different
took look bunch surveys internals  's deal  time poll less target national matchup
polling general gives person person edge security  overwhelming edge time gives person might slightly overstated
overall horse-race  time mag line polls
surveys  person ahead points average  's location time  + number ap/ipsos  - number person  + number location  + number cnn
time also line polls saying person 's lead comes advantage among women voters
's + number time  + number ap/ipsos  + number person ( 's narrowly trailing overall )  + number location
huge number-point advantage location number-point lead terrorism time gives person
recent polling suggests may overstated
pew 's recent poll gives person three-point lead location number-point lead terrorism
person  meanwhile  gives person number-point edge location - - line time - - also number-point margin security whole  like pew
bottom line  person clearly lost ground national security issues  despite trip
perhaps much ground time would suggest
