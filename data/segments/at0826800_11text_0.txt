global warming alarmists face yet another challenge predictions inferno doom
solar wind losing power  fifty year low  according organization
ulysses solar probe reports number % drop temperature  number % drop density  number % drop-off sun`s magnetic field  marking weakest period solar wind record ( records go back number`s )
mean
heliosphere thinning  thus block fewer cosmic rays
heinrick svensmark theorizes increase cosmic rays reaching earth drive cloud formation  increase planet`s albedo  thus cooling
cause earth`s unusually cool year
according person person  earth`s albedo reached nadir number  risen sharply since
related weakening solar activity
we`ve seen sunspots solar cycle number  solar conveyor belt slowed crawl  solar wind bottoming
allow us see really throes anthropogenic global warming ; temperatures rise ( haven`t since number ) factors solar activity driving climate trends  greenhouse gas theory falsified
cooling trend continues  climate alarmists throw towel
never fear ; they`ll come new cause keep adrenaline flowing !
probably ocean acidification  loss bees
