another - - next question also health issue - - asked person person kloepy  goes governor person
member audience  either concerned - - either concerned finding feasible way lower price pharmaceutical drugs education minimizing intake  revamp organization process streamlining drug companies ' procedures instead finding money pay
bush  well  's great question
think one problems  particularly seniors  prescription drug coverage medicare
therefore  try purchase drugs  's kind collective bargaining  power purchasing among seniors
think step one make sure prescription drugs affordable seniors  folks really rely upon prescription drugs lot days  reform medicare system  prescription drugs integral part medicare
problem today like patient 's bill rights  particularly health care  's lot bickering location  dc 's kind like political issue opposed people issue
want want call upon republicans democrats forget arguing finger pointing  come together take care seniors ' prescription drug program  says 'll pay poor seniors  'll help seniors prescription drugs
meantime  think 's important 's called immediate helping hand  direct money states seniors  poor seniors  ' choose food medicine
's part overall overhaul
purchasing powers
'm price controls
think price controls would hurt ability continue important research development
drug therapies replacing lot medicines used know
one important things continue research development component
'm price controls
expediting drugs organization makes sense  course
allowing new bill passed congress made sense allow  know  drugs sold overseas come back countries come back location location
makes sense
best thing reform medicare
moderator  vice president person  two minutes
gore  right  go
look  want someone spend lot words describing whole convoluted process end supporting legislation supported big drug companies  man
want someone fight fight middle-class families working men women  sick tired parents grandparents pay higher prices prescription drugs anybody else  want fight

discover great new cures 's great
want continue
spending money advertising promotion

research development
trying artificially extend monopoly patent protection keep charging high prices
want streamline approval competing generic drugs new kinds treatments compete bring price everybody
briefly  let tell prescription drug plan works
governor talked medicare
propose real prescription drug benefit medicare seniors  seniors  's works
pick doctor  nobody take away
doctor chooses prescription need nobody overrule doctor
go pharmacy medicare pays half price
