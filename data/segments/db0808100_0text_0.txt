see reason someone intellectually shallow slaughter - intellectual depth much function character willingness deploy term `` metric `` measures nothing real - holds important  prestigious job doesn ' deserve
've discussed slaughter 's bad ideas ( probably earlier well )
time struck truly weird manipulative writing style
consider  'll start offering metric assess candidate - - expert 's - - plan location
test best policy one likely bring troops home shortest time ( stop american casualties  begin repairing military  able redeploy badly needed military assets location )  also achieving progress goals administration stated publicly justification invading first place  number ) ensuring misc government could develop nuclear biological weapons mass destruction ( done ) ; number ) weaken terrorist groups seeking attack us ( goal based false premises  highly relevant ) ; number ) improve human rights misc people ; number ) establish government location could help stabilize liberalize middle east
policy possibly achieve goals
policy offers best chance five measures policy follow  view
applying measures concrete policy proposals debate
let 's look closely remarkable statement
merely typo slaughter enumerates four `` metrics `` calls five - indicates extent either fuzzy thinking dishonesty ( )
missing measure seems colon  suspect
using plain speech criterion count nine goals  told ( organization )
confusion comes slaughter plays shell game
`` number zero  `` uses liberal invocation `` bring troops home `` reality 's farthest thing mind ; actually  wants transfer troops location
number number  real goal `` establish government location `` - lucky - `` stabilize liberalize middle east  ``
surely  astute readers hullabaloo noticed reality  simply one `` metric `` slaughter advances judging candidates  whether 'll stay location ' til find pony
're done
slaughter purports serious voice - certainly credentials
deeply unserious proposals
one thing  slaughter lives world location location acts entirely isolated manner
much suggestion proposals foreign policy numberst century must  given modern interdependency nations  multi-lateral
finally  let us ponder first clump proposals - return troops us  repair military  ship `` military assets `` - means `` increase troop levels  `` tries finesse - location
's missing thought-out notion time expense
factor goals location  require us troops  talking years transfer assets could effected
billions upon billions dollar
us neither years cash
importantly  shouldn ' interest taking naive  expensive unilateral military action anywhere ( bringing unilateral action location  post  plain shabby rhetorical mush )
let put another way
slaughter finest mind location find `` dean location 's person person school public international affairs  `` bar successful academic career international affairs set dangerously low
