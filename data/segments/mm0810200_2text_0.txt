{ guest post see-dubya } feds catching clue
sounds good
's discussion cost initiative ( billion ) also secure-borders guy claiming hardened criminals serve sentences 're deported
's point  without secure border  come right back effectively enjoyed criminal illegal alien early-release program
hope prioritizing deportations focuses  example  murderers arrested misdemeanor would back street matter days 're deported immediately
convicted felons already serving time prison  well  damage done
make note  let serve sentence plane waiting take home day release
unless state decides differently
states may tired paying incarceration illegal immigrant criminals want send home
states want  's business
look cost issue way  illegal alien criminals state jails federal government failed obligation secure defend border
especially repeat offenders thrown kept
burden feds pay bill someone gets back commits crime  state arrest
( hat tip drj one  )
