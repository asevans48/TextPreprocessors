' know 've reading arguments topic 'm proposing government stop using word `` marriage `` replace words `` civil union `` number words apply heterosexual homosexual unions
would give homosexual unions rights heterosexual unions
however  government take advice  churches would still able deny perform homosexual wedding ceremonies
case gays ' miss `` rights `` wedding ceremony [ performed representative given religion ] right
government use word `` marriage `` homosexual unions  would churches required perform homosexual wedding ceremonies
wouldn ' mean government telling church can not
good idea government get `` business `` religion
churches forced perform homosexual weddings  would gay couples automatically accepted congregation
