won ' putting person ticket defang gop 's argument person 's inexperience  ( ) say
cares  replies newt
argument 's loser anyway  per democratic primary assorted polls
instead looking number two opportunity put screws person experience  looking opportunity leverage buzz change  secure knowledge left won ' dare attack person youth person 's record even thinner
' buy  partly ' think person enough fan base even within party yet bring much ticket partly experience fact play big decisions point newt makes near end
even basic age  inauguration day next year  'll still fully five years younger youngest man ever become president ( extreme precocity makes person 's age much striking organization )
rationally speaking  's silly distinguish capabilities number-year-old number-year-old  everyone 's going vote rationally
think 's worth risk  explain brings ticket point one else
still better suggestion  though  person person 's  per conclusion seems think person 's top priority choosing vp shouldn ' winning election much securing vision naming one republican likely antagonize christian base person
smart
