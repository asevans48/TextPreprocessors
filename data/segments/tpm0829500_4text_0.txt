one wonder whether person republicans  sense  victims success playing slime game
've thrown much vicious stuff person person via robocalls  mailers  ads  like - - 've succeeded comprehensively - - seems likely lost potency  ever
seems fair speculate paper slime currency gop printing furious rate lost value
call dsd syndrome - - defining slime
take  instance  mailer republican national committee 's getting attention today ( even though huffpo first posted five days ago )
shows plane hit airport says  `` person person thinks terrorists need good talking  ``
really going shock anyone
going move voters meaningful numbers
doubtful
multiple polls show one attacks - - one person 's association person person - - flop
suspect polling gop 's generic efforts insinuate person linked sympathetic towards terrorists various ways - - mailer - - would find
either way  point  person organization links person terrorists one way another 's dog bites man story
