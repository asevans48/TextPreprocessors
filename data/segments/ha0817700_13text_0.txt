determine standards
simple
use standards decency  go look whatever data scrounge social attitudes make seem like 're taking culture 's pulse
one might suggest  person  better gauge society 's standards democracy actual laws passes like  say  laws punishing child rape death case  every duly enacted punishment would constitutional per court 's test
're stuck charade majority pretends 's divined sort national ethos executing child rapists 's merely applying ethos instead imposing judgment 's right 's dressing people 's
irony ( one many  like  national ethos exists  court doesn ' leave public pass constitutional amendment formally recognizing   per alito  court won ' acknowledge 's prior rulings death penalty prevented true national ethos freely forming ) location 's standards actually evolved sensitive crimes committed kids
never public awareness greater abuse affects children psychologically  virtually one disputes rape  let alone rape child  life-ruining

stick dingy cell number years let waste away
's  square person 's claim murder uniquely terrible
forms existence physically psychologically painful death actually humane  guy murders child unthinkingly presumed done harm one beats  rapes  otherwise abuses 's basket case condemned life misery
