critics last night 's debate complain first half focused irrelevancies
unfortunately person person  didn ' much better relevancies  either
take instance portion debate person person asked capital-gains tax rate plans almost double
gibson makes clear raising tax rates reduce revenue  person assumes greater revenue anyway 's even clueless part exchange  read listen carefully
higher priority person isn ' raise revenue ; 's ensure fairness
order  government take bigger share gains redistribute social programs others
pretense money acts veneer good  old-fashioned redistributionismand example shows bias
talks billionaires paying different rate secretaries income  's purposeful
idea behind lower capital gains tax encourage risk-taking
secretary parable garners income much lower risk investors taken risk creating job
risk succeeds  generates much taxable income across board
doesn '  investors lose lot money
risk carries heavier tax burden  less money go towards investment
people instead put money safer  less risk-intense areas  savings low-yield bonds commodities gold
create fewer opportunities employment  translates across board less revenue government well stalled economy
surest way start economic disaster increase penalties investment
obama 's blindness capital gains reveals hard-left mindset
sees investors always profiting never losing  people work jobs created successful investment victims exchange rather beneficiaries
person wants use heavy hand government take away rewards risk invested  instead redistribute took risk create economic growth
kill engine drives american economy
obama either fails understand free-market economy grows  simply doesn ' care
either way  makes dangerous choice presidency
