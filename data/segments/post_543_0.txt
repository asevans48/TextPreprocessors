hate universal health care must hate idea taxes right
make judgment  think people 've dealt bad hand  small house debt eyeballs
wasn ' bad enough  kid got arm broken seven places something stupid
' pay surgery  're screwed
screwed completely
government isn ' going go door door jack people 's money  're going use taxes pay universal health care  's problem might well forget taxes completely look privately funded toll-roads absolutely everywhere ( already exist  small numbers )  schools little funding  fee absolutely everything
guess universal school care also stealing money one person giving another  nobody seems care right
everyone wants get education
shouldn ' get medical security
