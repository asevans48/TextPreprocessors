location announced find huge oil reserve place among top nations future oil production
new field may contain much number billion barrels
take years begin production  eventually decrease pressure oil markets  economy oil production requires expensive surveys deeper water
areas land already checked possible  well shallower waters
technology improving prices rising  becomes much feasible conduct test-drilling deep seas  oil found
expense considerable  however
even improved geological analysis  test holes succeed number % rate
costs test holes deep-sea locations run $ number million  means aggregate cost single successful hole $ number million
's find cap production  adds cost
's cheap  reward eventually outstrip investment time money
peak oil eventually arrive
presumably ; crude oil renewable resource
person  lot places explore  location proved
technology improves economics exploration become supportive  date may move significantly future
