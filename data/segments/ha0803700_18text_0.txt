'll say outset intent isn ' bash bush ignore good things done  particularly supreme court
intent get handle 's gone wrong might fixed
's striking similarity bush number person number presidencies  left parties weaker won presidency
person inherited democrat party dominated governorships  legislatures congress  left  republicans dominated state national politics across board
likewise  person inherited strong gop leaves  democrats congress dominate states
undoubtedly cyclical ; voters get tired party vote
one crucial difference  though  bush person exits 's parties find political forces
democrats person haven ' divided collection interest groups usually  republicans bush almost state civil war cusp nominating presidential contender unacceptable much party 's base
may president person 's fault  almost  republicans find shape 're  front-runner isn ' winning south  second-place candidate doesn ' win hotly contested primaries  third candidate 's social con populist know-nothing foreign policy win south

number
immigration
illegal immigration one among many issues upon republican coalition split  mainly along fault lines economic conservatives security conservatives
former favor less open borders supply cheap labor  latter see porous borders serious security threats
president person announced early number re-elected  would pursue comprehensive immigration reform
seen  rightly  code amnesty millions illegal aliens little real positive impact border security
previous amnesties followed pattern  led illegal immigration less security
base party didn ' like bush 's plan let know uncertain terms  voted back office largely war wasn ' person person
second term bush back comprehensive immigration reform  tried push congress
twice
teeth fierce conservative opposition  times
surrogates called opponents within party nativists like  along border security primarily national security issue
number-number  took new significance  person person person evidently never saw significance
nature reform plus way bush  mccain et al dealt fellow republicans opposition created split yet heal isn ' likely heal time soon
unfairly demagoguing issue calling opponents racist like tends leave bitter
bush foreseen  didn '  fracturing party
attention security base less inflammatory tactics could prevented outcome
also exacerbated tension person base
issues contributed losses number looks like loss coming fall  think three factors come closest explaining republicans split bickering among
three  easily foreseen prevented putting person person ticket
said  think person fine vp policy problems
presence hasn ' helped republicans figure bush
're wondering means future  person probably likely defend war doesn ' carry bush lied baggage
's plus
veep pick crucial reconciling conservatives  win  forecasting future politics gop
yet  's unknown
unfortunately  person bush immigration issue right smear tactics
's minus
