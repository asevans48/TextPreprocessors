person campaign circulating post person person asks pretty good question  group questionable donations name person funneled guy location misc national investigation war profiteering person person instead person person would bigger deal
yes  course would  answer pretty dispiriting
's unfortunate  judgments editors campaign journalists newsworthiness things  opinions pundits controversial  largely driven preconceived notions - - sometimes arbitrary ones - - candidates ' vulnerabilities
person  obvious ( obvious ) reasons  judged vulnerable charge 's terrorist sympathizer
person person seen vulnerable charge
thus  person received bunch shadowy contributions guy named person  would made easier gop exacerbate vulnerability already presumed exist
alone would make folks treat like bigger story
person  person deemed vulnerable charge  story make easier anyone land particular punch ; indeed  one would try
isn ' really deemed news resonance would person
similarly  person person botched joke troops stuck location  huge news made easier republicans paint anti-military - - charge 'd already deemed vulnerable  despite war heroism
location  gop house leader person person said troop losses location `` small price  `` wasn ' big deal republican couldn ' possibly ever imagined anti-military
person wasn ' deemed vulnerable `` anti-military `` charge  troop gaffe wasn ' important
irony  course  self-perpetuating dynamic
candidate deemed advance vulnerable particular accusation  stories play accusation get attention  turn makes candidate still vulnerable
things driving decisions isn ' news
works
sorry
person 's pro-war posture doesn ' make vulnerable story potential war-profiteering one biggest bundlers - - wouldn ' newsworthy result - - well  'll go elsewhere answer
'm totally stumped one
