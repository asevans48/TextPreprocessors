unreliable narratorsby digbyfrom 've read around sphere morning  person person made quite statement last night former bosses abc organization news influencing coverage run war
'm sure 've already heard
( haven '  read page  )
' know specifically network discussing  let 's say 's likely msnbc since wrote msnbcs egregious coverage time covered spoke  though
pressure top network known ages
never clear whether done political reasons  business reasons sheer cowardice  obvious beginning  matter much person person protests otherwise  page administration run war character assassination dissenters
lately  msnbc taken different tack  many us left celebrating
shows like person person 's  late party  help bury corpse bush administration last couple years organization supporters thrilled open advocacy chosen candidate major news network
danger well  particularly side comes depend upon kindness news organizations operate basis 's political fashion moment
person person  fervent obama supporter  brought possible downsides kind advocacy day  two weeks ago  night person person 's big win narrow loss location location location primaries  respectively  turned television set msnbc  normally election nights
early evening  person person person person discussing first exit polls trickling
considering exit polls contests been -- to say least -- a bit unreliable  assumed weren ' going put much stock numbers
two weeks earlier  watched msnbc 's coverage location primary  excited matthews practically gave state person  acknowledge later person easily won
surely  matthews company going make mistake
didn ' t -- but exit polls  predicting good night person  happened right ; coverage exactly
latest example network 's undeniable person favoritism
person person 's comment clintons ' `` pimping `` daughter  person  clearly boneheaded   person campaign spokesman person person pointed  caused stir among clintonites highlighted rest network 's anti-hillary coverage
's say slant bad business ; contrary
certainly made enjoyable television -- matthews often supremely engaging (   enjoy watching someone person seeing obama speak gives `` thrill going leg `` )  however withering  person frequently hilarious
network 's coverage helped create bubble around person supporters end neither healthy desirable
fact  msnbc 's bias actually hurt location senator
person cheerleading msnbc ( among others ) helped lead person 's new hampshire comeback
even think ( ) clintons made big deal `` sexist `` `` unfair `` portrayal candidate received press  watch enough msnbc  realize claim isn ' without truth
could believe otherwise person  trademark hauteur  told hillary `` voluntarily inadvertently  still awash filth [ campaign ]  `` person took self-evident glee trouncing person location caucus new hampshire primary
similarly  mocking person 's decision stay race  person bolstered argument `` boys `` trying push
finally  number primary nights  notably location ohio/texas  msnbc become excited early exit polls raised expectations person ultimately could live
question whether network 's coverage healthy person supporters little subjective
someone gets international `` hard `` news elsewhere  organization particularly appealing
increasingly started watching channel last year political focus  novelty seeing outspoken liberals television
often one hear news anchor rant corruption bush 's location
campaign progressed  however  became clear neither matthews person could stand hillary clinton
must admit  found appealing  too -- especially agreed hosts person campaign 's tactics either ridiculous dirty
still  downside quickly surfaced
person 's `` pimping `` remark matthews 's crude ( even somewhat accurate ) comment person person scandal boon hillary 's political career notable precisely nothing policy ideology
wasn ' person matthews person siding person issue individual mandates
rather  giving `` personal `` precedence `` political  `` network using hillary hatred fuel coverage similar fashion fox news uses democrat hatred excite viewers
distinction makes msnbc 's agenda almost disquieting fox 's
fox  believe people know 're watching something approximates gop talking points ( seeing analyst like person person spin hillary cnn doesn ' really stick  either ; everyone knows 's apparatchik )
msnbc  however  bias much harder pin
stem personal vendetta
sexism
corporate diktat
knows
person presidency bomb way similar george person person 's ( unlikely  sure  'm speaking hypothetically )  's difficult imagine msnbc would treat person reverentially fox still bush
( fact  could see issue like press access leading break channel president person even thrives office  )
conservatives ably chipped away press 's credibility past years  disturbing results ; now -- consciously not -- with aggressive  intra-democrat side-taking  organization thing
dangerously   msnbc 's coverage lead perverse sort cognitive dissonance viewers like  well
throughout primary process  often found much bullish location senator 's chances watching msnbc reason
person 's location victory  instance  remember hearing matthews ' description giant `` wave `` location sweeping across nation ; surely  race
likewise  month february  person won eleven straight primaries  recall watching network occasionally convincing person certain drop texas location chances become diminished
problem supposedly `` straight `` news anchors phrase questions leading ways  report one campaign 's spin fact  distorts actually going campaign -- even us make living obsessing writing politics
anchormen shill person  distinction talking points truth grows even blurrier still
much find msnbc entertaining  creation parallel  pro-obama universe type thing 'd expect fox
's know 's time change channel
cable news  msnbc particularly  major contributor sturm drang campaign
one main sources frustration among organization supporters notion 's obvious everyone months race  yet person refuses quit
hasn ' obvious person voters ( highly unlikely msnbc viewers point ) since still winning primaries
disconnect greater public cable networks exacerbated  much chagrin person voters anxious call race get person voters furious coverage standard bearer digging heels
realize seems ridiculous person supporters view press ' take correct  ' particularly blame
( indeed  'm crossing fingers msnbc 's positive coverage doesn ' disintegrate soon nemesis gone forced choose person manly flyboy  )
loathed minority people like  ' particularly love hate either primary candidate  still makes msnbc unreliable run war
chotiner points  since friendly democratic bias seems stem idiosyncratic  personal basis  behaving journalistic integrity ever  's corruption benefiting side time
always one felt country would better news media job
didn ' want `` `` network  much wanted functioning press corps
decided thing create balance  would hoped would ideological sympathy  fox  latest fashion subject change whim fickle public
thing remember short time ago msnbc using arguments today impeach president  help republicans steal election  flog bush 's war hard possible  firing reporters pundits refused adhere party line
help democrats beat person fall won ' crying
won ' cheering either  since 's matter time next shiny object waved faces 's likely something accrues benefit
people still bad politics

says `` many people running broadcasts wanted coverage consistent patriotic fever country time  ``
