three points  point one  purist want word ' marriage ' mean exactly invented word years ago defined  `` civil union man woman  ``
' want change meaning word `` loving union two individuals  ``
point two  someone wants something doesn ' mean entitled
matter noble gays may  matter important word  entitled
point three  gays started `` war `` trying take something feel strongly necessarily entitled
straights responded like anyone someone try take something away doesn ' necessarily belonged
gays want force straights share word
trying force someone something ' want usually results resisting equal greater force
thus propose gays create new word stop `` war  ``
