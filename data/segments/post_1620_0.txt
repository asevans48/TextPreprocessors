im getting married soon  benefits  actually havent even bothered find
also religion  religion doesnt require getting legally married
somthing show world life
also  hurts us allowing government violate constitution respecting beliefs established religion
point constitution would respect beliefs religions  instead persecuting
plus  religion law based primarily ( christianity )  supporting gay marriage supporting religion
support statement people register government get married  think good  otherwise people would one spouse get hurt due
