let 's stay subject  okay
saying two people love ' get married open door groups ridiculous argument
logic get rid marriage altogether  way none happen
institution old doesn ' mean shouldn ' changed
actually  fact old even reason change
thinking advanced since institutions reflect
homosexuals aren ' asking anyone change way life


want rights everyone else  right marry love
allow repeat question failed answer  gay marriage hurt one
