like virtually everyone else  understood immediately upon hearing going political problem  substance ( except hiv stuff  rank conspiracy theorizing ) weren ' indefensible
indeed  speak essence separates us lockstep  chauvinistic  american exceptionalism right
aren ' `` blame location first `` fifth columnists
neither `` blame america never `` means much clearer eye government 's sometimes irrational immoral actions conservatives
's tend civil libertarians skeptical inscrutable military adventurism

gave number reasons  's one think telling  [ m ] y biggest misreading competence
wars often marked incompetence
fatal misjudgment bush 's sense morality
idea complacent - even glib - evil men good intentions enable
truly believe bush would use number/number tear location conventions
first heard abuses gitmo  dismissed enemy propaganda
certainly never believed conservative would embrace torture central thrust anti-terror strategy  lie  scapegoat underlings  give us indelible stain location camp cropper location location secret torture interrogation sites created oversaw
certainly never believed war supported sake freedom would actually use central weapon deepest antithesis freedom - destruction human autonomy dignity torture
distort shredding english language  engaging newspeak long associated totalitarian regimes  insult
epiphany american conservatism come mean
know enemy much worse
never doubted
never believed location would america done
never
misjudgment deepest moral level bush person rumsfeld capable - misjudgment violated moral core enterprise - worst mistake
war done left location - lives lost  families destroyed  bodies tortured  civilization trashed - bad enough
done america - meaning america - unforgivable
forgive either
