believe people two fundamental rights relating issue  right self expression personal views/ideas
right secure physically emotionally
someone gets married - gay straight -  expression personal ideas
right location location location  least
marriage legal thing two people  part says man woman lies religion - based ideas founded centuries ago women considered objects anyway  thus fundamentally flawed viable final word
telling allowed get married  first denying right express ideas saying 's allowed  secondly denying emotional security 're descriminating
finally
matter gay couple gets married
hurting

denying ability say ' like

infringing two rights

disagree  doesn ' mean right say 's allowed !
's logical reason say isn ' allowed
