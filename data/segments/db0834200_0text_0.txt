defending companyby digbythere 's quite bit chatter person withdrawal suggesting organization veterans long time professionals really angry `` left `` saying someone high echelon member agency knowledge torture regime get job agency head
apparently  ' think rest world cares person fails deliver promise end practice ' see foreign policy necessity starting clean slate top
would wrong
irritating complaining 's evidently bubbling location left hostile organization trying tie hands  etc
fact left person staunchest defender bush years  never blaming bad decisions political bosses standing behind right tried crucify failure number/number wmd
good deed goes unpunished
meanwhile  past number years  right consistently characterized organization bunch hapless  unpatriotic  fools  writing things like like  recently year ago  yet never seen enemy
back embroiled person person scandal  `` left `` defending analysts organization used punching bags bush defenders  wrote post organization 's relationship left right years think worth reprising moment  've thinking lot plame affair brought interesting political contradiction  right openly contemptuous cia left vocal supporter
think 's probably good idea clarify bit ' get confused
fact sides always simultaneously vocal supporters openly contemptuous organization  entirely different reasons
( usually ' speak `` left `` purpose discussion use views proxy lefty argument  )
'm generally big fan secretive government departments accountability
always worry things sanctioned people often turned
long skeptical organization organization 's history bad acts around world sanctioned even known people often  hindsight  wrong - - - like rendition  instance
' believe secret foreign policy operation doesn ' answer people
tend bad shit leaves people holding bag
didn ' fall back arnold 's hummer  understand nation needs intelligence protect understand world
also understand way obtain information must kept secret order protect lives involved getting
never objected idea spies around world gathering information enemies
also think intelligence  much possible  objective apolitical
otherwise  can not accurately assess real threats
cia ( intelligence agencies ) make objective analyses  buck stop president  always properly
therefore  see plame affair - - larger matter pre-war wmd threat assessment - - matter compromised intelligence extension number year war right waged thinks organization 's tepid threat analysis
never mind right 's hysterical analyses always turned completely wrong
accuracy never point right takes opposite approach organization 's proper role
always entirely favor organization working behalf president wanted topple left wing dictator stage coup without congressional knowledge
view  proper role organization - - - covertly advance foreign policy behalf executive ( approve ) basically illegal immoral dirty work
never valued intelligence analysis organization produced since often challenged preconceived beliefs result didn ' validate knee jerk impulse invade  bomb  obliterate  topple somebody reasons ideology geopolitical power
organization 's intelligence often backed success containment policy kept us major bloody hot war commies - - - never trusted
( see team b  committee present danger parts ii  )
therefore  right sees plame affair another example inappropriately `` independent `` organization refusing accede boss 's wishes
believe organization exists provide president documentation needs advance foreign policy goals - - - includes lying precipitate war feels needed  job acquiesce
cut away verbiage  right really believes us justified invading occupying country likes - - - person 's sissified  cowardly rule ' o law prevents us
organization 's job smooth way president wants keeping citizen rubes allies line phony proof following international domestic laws
( would misc method governance - - - bad wise ones running world keeping rest us entertained religion bread circuses fucking lame  )
back day  used admit engaging realpolitik  disgusting  least honest current crop neocons insist righteous good advancing democracy vanquishing evil using undemocratic  illegal means
makes miss person
least didn ' sing kumbaya fucking wogs
idea people ' pay much attention political scene would come
may think government branch illegal dirty work
suspect would also think president allowed run secret foreign policy stage wars inscrutable reasons
indeed  think people would find repugnant knew people government think president location location right lie order commit blood treasure cause plan nothing one stated
course  's exactly happened location
right 's greatest challenge get public believe lied good
obviously didn ' meet challenge
larger point
person 's pals organization bellyaching `` ill-informed liberal bloggers `` obviously trying create solidarity right wing period liberal ascension
's perverse
right loathes far passionately left  would prefer whole agency replaced something far political quasi military already
left wants perpetrate illegal acts inevitably make location less safe found - - - likely globally sophisticated media world
isn ' morality  although 's certainly foundation argument
's also practical  torture  rendition  toppling foreign governments secret coups  dirty work  ended hurting location 's standing world
left right obviously different reasons mistrusting supporting organization
rationale differences stark find telling organization tends keep quiet publicly brutalized right go high dudgeon left rather mildly suggests someone closely associated bush torture regime ( failed speak forcefully  accounts ) would inappropriate choice head agency
according practices village  expect get back good graces `` center-right `` political establishment
' go wrong disparaging left - - - even defended character assassination derision eight long years
indeed  beating impressive
