literally  latest bank failure hit home today  although didn ' exactly surprise
location mutual carries mortgage  've done business wamu one way another number years
today sank banking history  government seized sold assets jp morgan chase  assure hot air readers didn ' cause failure
really trust
've fixed-rate mortgage ten years organization bought shortly loan made  've handled without fuss bother
also small checking account first mate uses  goes back well marriage  person bought home savings
jp morgan chase least one good asset
house
's pleasant thought
seriously  though  failure one banks bring home little  'll pardon pun
knew people branch lived location
people lose jobs  depositors protected apparently jpmc agreed guarantee deposits  fdic portions investors location lose big  meaning jobs likely get lost retirement funds shrink even
people didn ' make stupid investment decisions get tens thousands dollar location location person person  're going pay price anyway
'm sorry see wamu go  'm happy federal government acted quickly grab collapse meant taxpayer dollar bailout
jp morgan chase getting great deals collapses  're going run money pretty soon  failures start costing taxpayers lot money  even outside bailout
prepared lot pain
update  couple good points comments
first  best-case scenario bank collapse  private enterprise picks pieces  depositors ' get hurt  taxpayers ' foot bill
second  house worth significantly less falls  ' expect get upside-down mortgage
equity house cra  'll still equity afterwards
'm planning staying house long time  ' need worry sale price
