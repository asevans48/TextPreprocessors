cnn says location feels safer terrorist attacks since number
catch next several weeks figure  sounds bit vague
think 'll hit next eight ten weeks
probably
next number-number weeks
wouldn ' bet lot money won '
especially hopey person gets office
timelines aside  think 's something
organization organization 's getting creamed
've reviled repudiated location  although 're gaining strength europe location second one things getting kind hot location
meanwhile  haven ' done nearly enough lot holes around country ( hint hint southern border needs fence )  've wised little bit made harder hit
's ongoing process hardening rethinking  together aggressive disruption bigger cells 's kept terrorism location small isolated
magnitude isolated cells individuals could accomplish might change  course  ' get handle international nuclear bazaar
could change something location doesn ' like  decide send us message organization cheerleaders ( problem ought scared ofif worldwide threat got coverage deserved )
safer number/number
yeah  somewhat  think
extent  's 're keeping bad guys abroad looking shoulders predators instead giving leisure sit around map practice bomb-building skills
let 's face  need practice
think 've donetaking fight enemy working principle helped keep us safe
* 's 'm surprised political spin put
national security may less issue upcoming election  says cnn  hurts mccain
's pretty jarring cognitive dissonance
people feel safer ever terrorism military pressure 've put terrorists sponsors resolve 've ( imperfectly  yes ) demonstrated
hey  policy worked surprisingly well need try something else right !
people really see issue
cnn predicts americans see way
'  maybe people
think organization mellowed
suppose given weird  biased media coverage inflicted upon us  's possible gather impression
heroes news ; victory
wartime successes hidden covered  failures misjudgments blare every headline newscast number-number
whatever reason  people think 're safer
basically agree
question hope every patriot asks
policy works  shouldn ' support candidates  party  continue advance policy
* oh  plenty criticisms bush administrationbut stem departure  especially second term  principle taking fight enemy
