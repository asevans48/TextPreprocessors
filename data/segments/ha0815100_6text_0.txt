person person campaign continuing hammer away person person lobbyists campaign staff  person person wonders turnabout hasn ' made fair play yet
depends meaning word staff  apparently  location washington post discovered earlier week  obama 's campaign said response location active volunteer therefore could work campaign
isn ' getting little cute half
purpose no-lobbyist rule wasn ' obama ( person ) would eschew paying influence campaign
regardless whether volunteer occupy paid positions staff  obvious access candidate  supposedly point
actually  one considers issue  lobbyist volunteer political favors sounds suspicious paying work
one ask lobbyist expects receive hours volunteer
paid relationship would establish normal  above-board relationship  person would get compensation one would expect salary  rather favors road
's absurd issue case
lobbyists aren ' criminals ; represent groups citizens congress legislative matters
person person want reduce influence lobbyists  start reducing power scope federal government  creates spoils system thrive
would lot effective kicking campaign payroll  meaningful
however  person campaign response insults intelligence
person thinks lobbyists campaigns bad idea  shouldn ' working capacity campaign  paid
drawing distinctions grossly hypocritical laughably obtuse
