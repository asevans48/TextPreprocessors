denver post 's editorial board scolds city democratic convention committee tax-free gas habits  revealed less accidentally city council meeting week
also wonder aloud much city state shoulder costs  financial footing convention seems weak contracts haven ' even signed  post doesn ' mention  's also hypocritical another level
democrats congress want raise federal gas tax rest location  time actively evade paying
excuses pretty rich  post note
person tried telling press organization needed secure gas pumps fill-ups transporting vips  would anyone fill tank transporting city
course ; 'd
mere error  either
city actually contracted fuel service  contract supposedly pays city almost half-million dollar
suggests deliberate evasion part city well organization
even curious  contract yet signed technically city ' collect anything moment
hickenlooper using city funds subsidize organization 's efforts
