mr
newman  mr
president  rebuttal
president  yes
many things respond  'm going pick something said earlier
've country repeating something  admit  press also repeating - - believed nuclear missiles could fired called back
never  ever conceived thing
never said thing
discussion strategic arms negotiations  said submarines carrying missiles airplanes carrying missiles conventional-type weapons  destabilizing land-based missiles  also weapons - - carriers - - sent change  could call back launched missiles
