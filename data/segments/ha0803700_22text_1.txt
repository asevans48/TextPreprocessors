

see one two scenarios playing
nice john person shows  makes conciliatory sounds gotten message conservative issues  promises change still back pocket statement made location location actually changed positions
nice mccain won ' really fool anyone  won ' trying  'll make plausible case democrats weak trusted time war
fact 's apparently using sort resurrected reagan introduce cpac suggests may way 's going
another plausible scenario
mean person person shows uses cpac create sister souljah moment
think
's winning without conservatives attracting independents centrist democrats  though tv ads campaign rhetoric cast reaganite race
cpac isn ' large ; might number number attendance year
cpac made serious conservatives could easily painted radical intolerant even though 're
person snubbed cpac last year
could come year announce  essentially  doesn ' need year
msm would love would get tremendous buzz short term could use new kind republican talking point way november
think first scenario much likely second
'll make conciliatory sounds underneath person person  secure mind 's winning without conservatives 's reason change anything
second plausible  unfortunately
person history slamming right  's probably egotistical enough get carried away try something dramatic
costing thousand votes already ' count support pundits already skeptical  's side
mind  mean
'm sure sees reason listen conservatives discontented point
thursday interesting  say least
