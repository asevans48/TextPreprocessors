thank god
'm bit baffled statement senator person  `` think person person changed trajectory location way person person way bill person
put us fundamentally different path country ready
think felt like excesses numbers numbers government grown grown wasn ' much sense accountability terms operating
think people  tapped people already feeling  want clarity want optimism  want return sense dynamism entrepreneurship missing  ``
hate say 'm going get mercilessly roasted alive  jargon government growing growing without `` accountability terms operating `` `` dynamism `` `` entrepreneurship `` sounds awful lot like organization boiler plate
capitulated `` reagan revolution `` hype exactly way number 's developed entire political strategy around
's biggest star  movement fully realized number  global economy numbers  economic growth won ' come government spending
come instead individuals working smarter learning  entrepreneurs taking risks going new markets  corporations designing better products taking longer view
