`` 's gene randomly causes homosexuality number % 's carriers  turns homosexuality benefit population whole  evolution applies  ``
believe `` 's good group `` model evolution firmly discredited  common misunderstanding evolutionary behaviour
firstly  let address concept gene
constitues gene subjective  better us talk `` units evolution `` ' confuse thinking genes single entity controls single operation
order homosexuality genetic rather simple hormone disbalance  would show significant grouping genes single homosexual unit evolution  unit evolution strives save purely altruistic methods
general idea `` good group `` seems first possible intepretation evolution larger scale
however  correct interpretation good unit evolution
altruistic behaviour appears benefit individual  obviously trait something altruistic would find hard saturate gene pool ; therefore absolutely benefit saving another
however  think purely level unit evolution  see apparently unhelpful behaviours ( animal informing animals approaching predetor  whilst also making visible said predator ) saturate gene pool gene geared saving
means realistically two ways unit saturate gene pool certain unit space ; benefits individual carrying  causes individual benefit individuals likely carrying unit evolution
homosexuality lends lack saving `` `` ( wont passed )  realistically become evolved trait causes altruistic behavior causes carriers likely survive
know evolution understand concepts
point 'm making homosexuality doesn ' appear lend altruistic behaviour would benefit people carrying homosexual unit evolution
infact  recognition homosexual people order better select benefit would mean person also homosexual therefore less likely pass gene
main point made thus  altruistic behaviour unit evolution hunders towards units evolution also actually hinder reproductive potential would extremely unlikely saturate gene pool
