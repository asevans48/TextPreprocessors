define bipartisanship
well  apparently democrats capitol hill  's defined house senate democratic caucuses room time
democrats congress held bipartisan hearings address financial crisis bailout package  forgot invite people attend  gee  harry  house republicans critical plan  didn ' anyone think invite meeting
taxpayers around country concerned leadership incompetent forget invite party bipartisan meeting
person person person person ' handle invitations  handle complex financial crisis
interestingly  location post reports today person person 's return location got house republicans game
reid bleats important house republican caucus success  person person cut loop person 's return  person arrived  reid person tried sideline house republicans  cutting discussions
reasons twofold  quite plain
house republicans group conservative senate counterparts major reservations signing onto $ number billion bailout plan  regardless situation hand
second reason person didn ' need  least time ; could force vote house carry bill easily without  apparently decided senate republicans went along
person 's arrival changed calculus
democrats longer ear senate republicans  waited see new party leader would say
sided boehner  least terms bringing table getting house republican concerns addressed real consensus  forced reid  person  person talk person
's snub bohner house gop came accident
still ' need boehner win vote house
unfortunately  since person shone light person 's power play  need boehner political cover
means work towards true consensus  misc plan blame solely george bush final weeks election
