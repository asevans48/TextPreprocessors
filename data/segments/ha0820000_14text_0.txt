would anyone
ruffini wonders  follow link refresher dismal fate historically vp candidates  especially losing vp candidates  reach brass ring
anyone want try floating plausible scenario 'd see bush/mccain/romney succession  even maverick serves one term
three men party haven ' consecutively independently elected since grant  person  garfield post-civil war republican stranglehold government
( 'm counting mckinley/roosevelt/taft harding/coolidge/hoover since sequences involved presidential deaths  )
good luck replicating public opinion gop
way could conceivably person 's presidency dramatic break bush phenomenally successful  transforming dynamic three republicans row old republican/new republican/new republican
phenomenal success likely heavy democratic majorities houses
another way saying mitt 's hellbent presidency  needs person lose  ironically  makes hillary maverick 's person  albeit even
's reason join ticket plenty reason  ruffini notes  surf vp buzz raise national profile
exit question one  really simple  though
mitt 's enough boy scout person went said needs ticket good country  probably couldn ' say  whatever consequences ambitions
even stay ticket person loses  's catbird-seat position number
maybe starts presumptive frontrunner  conservatives looking something fresh aging  fabulously wealthy patrician white guy 's consistently underperformed electorally doesn ' match well person person
exit question two  per ruffini 's logic  would anyone want ticket year
thanks youth  person person marginally better positioned mitt re-create later lose vp  make number task harder
person might find stuck person person figure doesn ' strong national ambitions  doesn ' really expect win time  doesn ' much lose saying yes
