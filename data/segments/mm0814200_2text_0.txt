pretend second 're wrong location
think like liberal
assume location tells truth say really want nuclear energy  's 've started enriching uranium
imagine   israel-off-the-map stuff ahmedinejad really rhetoric keep yokels line kind serious threat
say 've misunderstood location
turns 're ones misunderstanding  maybe think news location making nuclear weapons neocon lie
think 's also true location  location location  nearly dozen nations region ready spin centrifuges
also well-intended assuming location
( even ignoring possibility bad intentions  sufficiently careful things
nuclear weapons 're talking
organization organization country  )
anyway  nationsislamic nations   neocon islamophobe warmongersare signalling willingness go nuclear deter believe location 's nascent nuclear arsenal
means 've hit situation location 's desire make secure (  since assuming best hereto make less reliant fossil fuels reliant nuclear power ) organization makes region less secure
's name effect among international-relations set  's called security dilemma  location knows  course  know neighbors
location wanted stop effect  would comply international law
aren '
's risky game  think person 's return around corner 's side  care
especially organization organization ( organization ) detonates misc nuclear device location long beach
course  obamessiah sits explains  'll slap foreheads say oh  're ninnies !
'll dismantle whole nuclear program tomorrow
sorry confusion
