corruption dysfunction rampant  last week general petraeus conceded one  either us government misc government  feels sufficient progress means area national reconciliation
middle summer additional surge forces sent home  'll right back square one number troops ground location
president person seems want keep many troops surge says otherwise would endanger progress clear admission surge accomplished goals
meanwhile  continue police iraqs civil war  threats national security  economy  standing world continue mount
lives brave men women stake
nearly number   made ultimate sacrifice
tens thousands suffered wounds visible invisible bodies  minds  hearts
families sacrificed   empty places dinner table  struggle raise children alone  wrenching reversal parents burying children
strength military stake
one army brigades certified army ready
armed forces stretched near breaking point many troops second  third  fourth tours duty
economic security stake
taking consideration long-term costs replacing equipment providing medical care troops survivors ' benefits families  war location could ultimately cost well $ number trillion
enough provide health care number million uninsured americans quality pre-kindergarten every american child  solve housing crisis  make college affordable every american student  provide tax relief tens millions middle class families
ability win war location stake
first visited location number  greeted soldier said  `` welcome forgotten front line war terror  ``
since  organization organization organization continued gain new footholds throughout country  result  overall terrorist threat  intelligence community noted  growing
finally  leadership world ability front global challenges  present future  stake
extremism location  nuclear ambitions location location location  troubling antidemocratic trends location location location  threat global epidemics global warming rise location
world regards us suspicion rather admiration  difficult confront challenges
despite evidence  president person determined continue failed policy location leaves office
senator person gladly accept torch stay course  keeping troops location number years necessary
want keep us tied another country 's civil war  war can not win
location bush/mccain location policy
dont learn mistakes  repeat
well  inescapable reality
hundreds thousands troops ground number years  change fact military solution situation location
' take
confirmation hearing  admiral mullen  chairman joint chiefs staff  said without national political reconciliation  amount troops amount time make much difference
simply can not give misc government endless blank check
passing month stay location gives misc government time avoid hard decisions split oil money share political power
senator person president person claim withdrawal defeat
well  let 's clear  withdrawal defeat
defeat keeping troops location number years
simply can not give misc government endless blank check
passing month stay location gives misc government time avoid hard decisions split oil money share political power
senator person president person claim withdrawal defeat
well  let 's clear  withdrawal defeat
defeat keeping troops location number years
defeat straining alliances losing standing world
defeat draining resources diverting attention key interests
withdrawal risk-free  risks staying location certain
well-planned withdrawal one path political solution
way spur iraqis take responsibility future ensure ' bear responsibility indefinitely
way spur countries part help secure stability region
commitment staying location driven president person 's foreign policy
looks like would drive senator mccains foreign policy well  drive mine
foreign policy driven americas national security interests
time end war quickly responsibly possible
mission senate  mission starting day one president location location
past five years  served senate armed services committee
location location three times
met soldiers military leaders
met misc  local  regional  national elected influential officials
home ive attended countless meetings committee hearings challenged high-ranking organization officials military leaders investigating situation location  probing facts presented  demanding real answers tough questions
honored number americas esteemed former admirals generals  including two former chairmen joint chiefs staff five retired officers four-star rank endorsed candidacy
american people ' guess whether im ready lead whether understand realities ground location whether id dependent advisers help determine right way forward
ive working day-in day-out senate provide leadership end war
thats cosponsored legislation senator person person reauthorize war  legislation would actually end president 's authority fight
thats ive started laying ground work swift responsible withdrawal beginning early number demanding organization start planning
ive introduced legislation ensuring congress would briefed plans 's also im working block president person 's effort keep war going leaves office
ive introduced legislation banning unilaterally negotiating long-term security commitment location  including possibility permanent bases
believe matters campaign promises 've made end war ; matters 've actually done came time match words action
anything else  've done indication 'll
democratic opponent talks great deal speech gave number  commend making speech
speaking believe solemn  patriotic duty
asking us judge words  words powerful  speaker translates action solutions
senator person holds original opposition war campaign trail  didn ' start working aggressively end war started running president
chance act speech  chose silence instead
campaigning senator person tells voters president 'd withdraw combat brigades location within number months  one top foreign policy advisers told different story
told misc television reporter  quote  ``  course  rely plan 's crafted presidential candidate us senator  ``
senator person said often words matter
strongly agree
giving speeches alone won ' end war making campaign promises might keep certainly won ' end
end true test speeches president delivers  's whether president delivers speeches
concrete  detailed plans end war  waivered commitment follow
one choice election senator person
hes willing keep war going number years
count
another choice senator person promised bring combat troops number months  according foreign policy adviser  ' count
uncertain times  can not afford uncertain leadership
heres count  provide leadership end war quickly responsibly
today id like talk  president  bring troops home  work bring stability region  replace military force new diplomatic initiative engage countries around world helping secure misc future
important part plan first step  bring troops home send strongest possible message iraqis must take responsibly future
talk permanent occupation  policing civil war  iraqis need
president  one first official actions convene joint chiefs staff  secretary defense national security council direct draw clear  viable plan start bringing troops home within first number days taking office
plan based consultation military remove one two brigades month  plan reduces risks attack depart
bring troops home  ensure fully prepared take care families returned
direct department defense department veterans affairs prepare comprehensive plan provide highest quality health care  disability benefits  social services every single service member including every member national guard reserve well families  make sure plan promptly implemented
senate im proud reached across aisle provide access tricare members national guard reserve  even 're deployed
passed heroes home act help family members care traumatic brain injury  signature injury war believe brave men women sign serve country  sign serve
also immediately adopt representative person person urgent proposal reduce strain troops reducing permissible length overseas deployments
going forward  ensure troops spend much time tome spent deployed
every month spend field  guaranteed one month home
also implement proposal  representative person  others calling  requiring brigade deployed  secretary defense must certify congress fully combat ready
sending brigades meet standard puts soldiers danger mission location elsewhere risk
addition removing american troops location  also work remove armed private military contractors conducting combat-oriented security functions location
five yeas behavior lack supervision accountability often eroded credibility  endangered us misc lives undermined mission
senator person substantive disagreement
won ' rule continuing use armed private military contractors location jobs historically done us military government personnel
president ask joint chiefs help reducing reliance armed private military contractors
goal ultimately implementing ban contractors
ive already cosponsored stop security outsourcing act requiring security services personnel us diplomatic consular mission provided federal government personnel
also time put end   no-bid contracts squander taxpayer money lining pockets president 's cronies
number number  spending no-bid contracts doubled  representing half federal procurement spending
today companies like organization enjoying record profits thanks number % increase taxpayer funds awarded
recent congressional report identified number contracts valued $ numbernumber trillion federal auditors found massive overcharges  wasteful spending poor oversight
im proposing legislation ensure new spending number done competitive contracting processes
heads agency would certify congress sworn affidavit contracting awards processes open competitive
president  work pass legislation law end era no-bid contracts handouts location
interesting comparison
weve lot talk town elsewhere earmarks  one believe need transparency disclosure earmark process
no-bid contracts ten times costly earmarks  introduce legislation eliminate no-bid contracts  could get  least moment  senator mccains support
bring troops contractors home  can not lose sight strategic interests region
reality war made terrorists stronger
well  may location war   can not allow location become breeding ground safe haven terrorists seek attack us friends allies
let clear - plan  withdrawing location mean retreating fighting terrorism location
thats order small  elite strike forces engage targeted operations organization organization location
protect misc citizens  allies  families right home
second part plan involves working secure stability within location bring troops home  stability key successful withdrawal troops
believe 's really quite simple  greater political economic stability means safer conditions departing troops smoother disengagement military 's actions across location
right one doubts misc government failing citizens
government officials refuse take steps need order advance solution  improve economy  quell misc violence better lives ordinary iraqis
failings  part  fault iraqis part due bush administration 's failure match military efforts political ones
example  us created armed local security forces  awakening location `` concerned local citizens  `` fail hold misc government agreement integrate local militias volunteers provincial police forces national army
violence fallen short run  long run sectarian divisions among iraqis may deepen
im president  pursue integrated strategy
well empower local leaders use us international influence press iraqis reach political reconciliation  call organization organization strengthen role promoting reconciliation
party mistakes path five years  un  already provided valuable technical assistance location  far likely viewed neutral  honest broker location location  especially acts behalf broad coalition concerned states international community
new united nations secretary general  ban ki-moon  indicated willing play key role assisting iraqis
also work location location ensure un envoy location necessary authority obtaining security councils explicit endorsement strengthened un mandate promote reconciliation
also call upon un help oversee resettlement millions refugees fled location displaced internally
many living desperate conditions creating humanitarian crisis one affecting regional stability poses direct threats security home must address immediately
focus efforts improving conditions iraqis ' flee first place  recognize moral obligation help put risk location  interpreters  soldiers assisted troops
work governments middle east west  including course location location  find places asylum seekers  work un develop plan help return  possible  location country stabilized
would seek stabilize location insisting country 's oil revenues  instead us taxpayer dollar  increasingly used fund iraqs reconstruction
president person began war  administration claimed misc oil revenues would pay iraqs reconstruction
well  misc government earned tens billions dollar oil
estimates indicate revenues year top $ number billion
yet since beginning war  us allocated roughly amount money location reconstruction  $ number billion us versus $ number billion
even clearer misc government spending oil money reconstruction
reports location spent less quarter oil funds set aside reconstruction number  us comptroller general testified november number capital expenditure rate central ministries location number %
oil profits showing foreign banks even misc citizens lack basic services
president would immediately direct inspector general location appoint special council investigate make recommendations directly ensure misc oil revenues us taxpayer dollar declining trend used rebuild location
unacceptable oil revenues go unused worse end private accounts citizens lack electricity clean drinking water
support iraqs efforts rebuild country  permit money thrown away
work crack black market oil location
according recent news reports  insurgent groups profiteering substantial black market oil
money make going part pay ieds  car bombs  tools terror
misc government simply done part crack corruption
equation simple  cut disrupt illegal sources funding  deny insurgents money need maintain campaigns violence
order joint nationwide misc crackdown black marketers oil smugglers
well beef protection oil lines prevent illegal tapping attacks
cut illegal networks  identify stolen oil goods going  stealing  capture responsible
work international community try cut access funds hold oil revenues
maintain crackdown success sending strong signal misc government  show results rooting corruption lose aid
third final part plan end war involves replacing military force location intensive diplomatic initiative region
past four years  've learned hard way need truly multilateral approach location  one built sound strategy long-range planning  ideology wishful thinking
president 's go alone strategy diminished position region around world  diminished position  turn  made increasingly difficult us bring political solution
friends allies region especially large stake building stable location  part bush administration 's mismanagement war  lacked leadership gotten free pass
must end
ten months new opportunity reach engage allies
one first international meetings president would treaty allies friends region including location location  location  location  european allies
course career known worked many leaders already  send clear message - happens location affects interests  responsibility
time part paid fair share
convene regional stabilization group composed key allies  global parties  states bordering location
mission group develop implement strategy create stable location
would include regional stabilization group location location
must convince countries region beyond refrain getting involved misc civil war  hold others past pledges provide funding location  support central role united nations
critical first steps toward establishing new american approach world  one draws strength alliances power diplomacy  uses greatest military force earth last  first  resort
achieving easy
' choice
look road ahead  think men women uniform ive profound honor meeting serving
troops serving location location  across globe
veterans recovering va
hospitals rehabilitation centers home  many serious life-altering injuries
countless veterans given support services need reenter civilian life
men women made extraordinary sacrifices serving country love  im always struck matter extent severity suffering  matter grave injuries  always say thing  `` promise 'll take care buddies
theyre still
promise 'll keep safe  ``
looked men women eye  made promise  intend honor ending war responsibly quickly possible
thank  much
