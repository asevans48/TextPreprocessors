let 's say someone created effigy certain national political candidate placed noose around neck  put effigy display neighbors see halloween
kind reaction would expect see
people would start screaming organization number latent racism american voter  would assume neighborhood located red state people bitterly cling guns religion
wait  national candidate question isn ' person person  's red-state neighborhood long shot  hanging effigy seen art  long target acceptable community  seems
's political statement !
's good  clean halloween fun oh-so-tolerant friends west hollywood
others neighborhood see double standard  know else sees double standard
artist  gee  think
instead  's republican woman getting lynched effigy  suddenly becomes art good  clean fun
maybe start talking latent misogyny left  drooling bigots enclaves
effigy person  say  location  'd certainly hearing halloween spooky art  instead racist person 's opponents
