boumediene rendering foreign detention moot  usefulness prison location location appears outlived legal usefulness
presidential candidates declared intention close gitmo rapidly  makes fate clear case
shut
's question president person begun considering  according organization news  could become congress ' nightmare soon
person decides close gitmo  us decide number detainees currently held facility
unless get freed returned native governments prosecution  us find new facility hold  bush administration likely put burden congress years heavy criticism person received gitmo
none options look palatable
detainees remain determined dangerous military tribunal reviews
either receive trials american courts misc civil legal standards play misc would almost certainly wind failing  given circumstances detention  congress establish different standard supreme court would probably reject  boumediene
options rendition release
bush hands tied
without recognition military tribunals  reason hold prisoners abroad
apply law-enforcement standards person rights foreign terrorists captured abroad military intel personnel  ' bring us see get released cities
rendition looks like promising option  would almost certainly result torture detainees return places like location location location
closing gitmo always going easy part
