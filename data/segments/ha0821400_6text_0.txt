research team mit claims discovered process make solar power practical mass production energy  even sun doesn ' shine
using photosynthesis guide  team believes discovered nirvana exploiting sun 's power generate reliable  stable  safe source electricity  've cold-fusion roller coaster  color skeptical moment
study got published yesterday  nocera person endure scrutiny peers
however  works cheap people believe  could revolutionize energy production  least certain applications
solar energy 's drawback always storage
solar cells produce electricity good efficiency sun shines  night overcast conditions  production becomes unreliable
true environmental-based alternatives wind power  hydro  boutique offerings  article calls
fuel cells work well  big problem generating hydrogen cheaply efficiently
current electrolyzers either expensive used dangerous damaging materials
solution combines best worlds
sun shines  photovoltaic energy produce enough electricity power house car well photosynthesize elements fuel cell
instead storing electrical energy battery  fuel cell retains elements needed provide power solar panels wind turbines drop production rates
pans  could decentralize electrical production allow household run independently grid  even sell excess power back grid
electric vehicles would become much practical fuel cells rather massive batteries  distribution fuel-cell hydrogen would longer required
could spell end emissions problems make us completely independent foreign oil sources short period time
course  mighty big
could also cold fusion
need continue drilling oil near term ensure energy security protect economy
's worth watching
