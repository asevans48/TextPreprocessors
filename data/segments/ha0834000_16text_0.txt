well person person 's attempt unseat plurality conservative government play canadian electorate
well fumbled speech
new poll shows majority canadians would wanted new election instead  number % would support conservatives higher last election  thought person person one shot leg last week !
liberals  ndp  organization organization made serious error
strange reason  assumed voters thoroughly regretted votes cast seven weeks earlier would welcome leadership even though voters sent conservatives parliament october dion already agreed resign liberal party leadership position result failure
confirmed conservatives make better leaders even troubled times  've also convinced majority shutting parliament great idea
means liberals  ndp  bq won ' relevance next two months
canadians welcome development
looks like dion/layton strategy worked wonders person
calling coup  course  bit tongue-in-cheek
opposition legal  radical departure parliamentary tradition
's close coup canadians ever come  probably opposition frightened three-quarters electorate action  've destroyed credibility leadership majority voters
