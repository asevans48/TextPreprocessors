interview took place almost four years ago  perfect illustration man elected purely name recognition  dirty money  discernible talent
four years ago  still enough americans believed bush 's infantile bluster charming direct

interview person go record definitive proof bush 's utter incompetence  priceless picture madman business occupying highest office land
epiphany watched interview
swaggering  sarcastic  petulant bush reminds strongly young version person
