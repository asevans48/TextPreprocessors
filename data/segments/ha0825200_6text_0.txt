guess barack person doesn ' read hot air  listens wisdom allahpundit
team o got flustered today 's original mavericks ad rushed new spot today  apparently rudimentary fact-checking
person argues bridge nowhere shows real maverick  's true person didn ' start opposing bridge  governor made decision kill
least moved right direction
voted first place
john mccain ; derided senate floor  despite pet project republican colleague
two votes came barack obama person person  let 's take look amendment
person  real anti-pork reformer  tried cancel earmarks redirect funds hurricane katrina relief
gave senate second chance stop bridge nowhere use funds help victims storm obama likes use example leadership
yet  supposed maverick ad running mate chose support ridiculous $ number million bridge nowhere instead
laughable hypocrisy ap 's earlier post person 's decision use location bridge attack palin
supported ; failed change mind given second chance ; person owns bridge right along person person
yet blames person earmark isn ' good reformer  stopped despite person 's best efforts build boondoggle
' make
hopefully  captain earmark ( $ number million pork counting  shady connections ) continue two things way election day  keep talking earmarks keep attacking person
goes republican running mate  equates makes mccain look presidential
