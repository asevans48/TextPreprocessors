twenty five appointed organization chair howard dean  remainder alloted state  numbers based state 's population democratic performance
process determines credential committee members split candidates convoluted one
gist state 's delegation credentials committee allocated candidates number 's proportional number pledged delegates won state
hillary could conceivably get marginally higher proportion members committee bigger states  's won
bottom line end breakdown committee hew closely overall breakdown pledged delegates
presuming things continue  hillary majority  person members committee
happens
well  location location delegations petition seated
delegations ask straight seating suggest creative solutions problem
alternatively  outside parties might suggest solutions committee
formal process committee decides vote particular proposal
basically  discussion  committee agrees hold vote particular proposal seating delegations one way another
(  alternatively  committee would consider separate solutions state 's problem  )
point  three things happen
