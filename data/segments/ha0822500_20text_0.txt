update & bump  aol 's hot seat used question couple days late  'm sending post back top  embedswf ( number  number  number  `` widget ``  `` recent `` ) original post follows
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  politicians survived exposure adulterous affairs
person person survive
adultery disqualify people political office  electoral appointed  edwards case represent extreme hope political redemption
first  let 's tackle general question infidelity political office
assume politicians class commit infidelities least general rate rest population  perhaps even greater  given expanded opportunities afforded
obviously  becomes risk higher levels politics  truth elect human beings office  saints person congress reminds us somany ways
really business outside working hours
course  ' separate two
bill clinton seduced starry-eyed intern number years junior committed perjury cover affair  well person person 's attempts buy job organization  much investigators believed person got webb person quit cooperating
edwards ' case similar ; paramour  rielle hunter  worked campaign  apparently received money campaign officials afterwards  certainly suggests someone wanted keep quiet
( self-admitted father child also received stipends  suggests edwards and/or staff wanted happy well  )
'll get back minute
normal circumstances  infidelity disqualifier
shaun mullen makes character argument tmv today  's fair question
politician proves unfaithful personal relationship  's say person won ' sell constituents power  money  fame  adultery
clinton 's appetites supposedly grew large feared admitting anythingfor deluge would follow
person person bill clinton committed actual crimes connected infidelities  pointed
perjury felony resulted person 's impeachment disbarment  although conviction senate
spitzer even worse  hypocritically launching crusades prostitution rings political gain patronizing high-priced prostitutes time
private matters public betrayals office cases
shaun picked one example considered discussion topic story broke show yesterday
gary hart dropped number presidential race affair person person got exposed  following foolish challenge reporters rumors infidelity number
however  hart recovered enough regain position elder statesman  politically
person retained enough respect could run office  chosen
( see update ii  )
could edwards
rather doubt  although 's probably soon tell
edwards nowhere near time politics person  nowhere near amount real accomplishment respect
person 's affair didn ' anywhere amount messiness edwards-hunter relationship  either
's
listening edwards following allahpundit 's excellent coverage yesterday  doubt anyone thinks got whole story
affair ended number  edwards skulking around hotel la hunter staying baby number  especially number morning
certainly indicates edwards hunter kind ongoing relationship  one terribly compatible monogamous marriage
edwards ' assertion never loved hunter sounded cruel tawdry  though wanted publicly state exploit hunter little pleasure
sounds like heard lawyer  spin team  mouthpiece real human
still leaves us question  demand loyalty oaths politicians constitution  also spouses
media get business tracking ensure remain faithful
really business nothing job
demand bosses  employees  friends media  matter
perhaps practical answer version person ' ask  ' tell ; long ' find  remains none business
's open  consider character flaw
update  person person gets close hart/edwards difference new organization organization column  excoriates edwards manner indicates political resurrection may never arrive among former friends left  perhaps better way expressing edwards nevera good candidate high office many reasons
rather hunter affair ruining  revealedhim
man called silky pony detractors  person admits  less earned monicker lack depth
better man could rise ashes  person person
better man wouldn ' put particular position  reacted poorly
update ii  originally  wrote person exposed number cycle  incorrect
several people e-mailed commented correctly person 's affair came light number  expected ascend nomination easily  candidacy sunk monkey businessstory
regret error
