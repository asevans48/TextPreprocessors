let 's see straight
democrats running president offer tax cuts middle class  counterparts congress assume won ' get put place crafting next budget
certainly sends mixed message  somewhat along lines person person 's nafta dance
congressional democratic leadership prepared budget won ' work either republican democratic nominees
also  revenue assumptions come static analysis bush tax-cut expirations
assumes revenue stream remains static   tax policy affect market produces incomes taxes derive
know false ; tax policy impact markets  impacts incomes therefore tax revenue
government takes capital market  less remains generate new business expansion existing business  shrinks demand labor
shrinks demand goods  market return higher tax rates actually produces less revenue
means underlying assumptions budget entirely false 's get notion war end number
expiration tax cuts produce revenue person cohorts assume purpose budgeting
predicted surplus never arrive  instead taxes put enough burden economy push recession
require even stimulus spending  means greater federal deficits taxation person cover gap
george bush threatened veto  democrats believe bluffing
claim difference bush 's budget $ number billion
interestingly  's amount pork numberth congress stuffed last budget  suspect one may even
democrats want spend extra $ number billion  cut pork year 's budget fund
're willing  maybe explain need increase tax burden option
