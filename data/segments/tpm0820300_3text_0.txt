wow  getting kind surreal
noted  washington post yet stand-alone story person 's endorsement person 's troop-withdrawal timeline
look person reporting misc government official person person 's assertion 's hopeful us troops number  `` eight months later person 's proposal  ``
got
person 's comments odds person 's plan
real
first  unlike new york times  los angeles times  associated press  wapo buries person 's comments - -
still lack clarity person said
wapo quotes follows  `` ' give schedules dates  misc government sees suitable date withdrawal us forces end number  ``
hand  associated press ' version makes sound like wants time number didn ' specify end year
doesn ' really matter  however
even quote says wants end year doesn ' really preclude earlier year
spinning somehow counter person 's plan borderline farce
