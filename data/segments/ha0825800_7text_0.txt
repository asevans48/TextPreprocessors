two ' appear go together one reads twin profiles new york times location post
part  's pretty easy determine
press spent last two weeks location  anchorage  location could find complaints people fired person person time mayor governor
so-called troopergate scandal gets scant mention either article  making 's left series petty comments number % alaskans ' like person
reading  'd give post credit balance  although 's damning faint praise
starting point person liked fire political appointees previous administrations
perhaps 's unusual location  neither paper makes case even attempts
's certainly business usual location  many political appointees get walking papers every election  whether incumbent president gets re-elected

times doesn ' report complaints
's bad choice  havemeister succeeded
reformers usually clean house  's person
rather worry resumes  focus successes failures appointments

two weeks digging  find  papers need write travel investment total loss
point taken articles person made entrenched bureaucrats angry  sounds like win team person
update  jazz shaw dissents  point judgment certainly well taken
