ms
walters  mr
kraft  governor carter
mr
kraft  ah - governor carter  ah - nearly two-hundred-year history constitution  've uh - think 's twenty-five amendments  issues broadest principle
uh - proposed amendments many highly specialized causes  like gun control  school busing  balanced budgets  school prayer  abortion  things like
think 's appropriate dignity constitution tack amendments wholesale fashion
ones listed -  uh - balanced budgets  school busing  school prayer  abortion  gun con - control - would really work hard support president
mr
carter  would work hard support
uh - 've always  think  lot constitutional amendments proposed  passage uh - fairly slow  uh - far
two-hundred-year history 's uh - cautious approach
- quite often transient problem
- 'm strongly - abortion
think abortion 's wrong
' think government oughta anything encourage abortion
' favor constitutional amendment subject
short constitutional amendment  within confines supreme court rulings  'll everything minimize need abortions better sex education  family planning  better adoptive procedures
personally ' believe federal government oughta finance abortions  - draw line ' support constitutional amendment
however  honor right people seek constitutional amendments school busing  uh - prayer schools abortion
among named  won ' actively work passage
ms
walters  president person  response  please
mr
ford  support uh - republican uh - platform  calls constitutional amendment would uh - outlaw abortions
favor particular constitutional amendment would turn states uh - individual right voters states uh - chance make decision public referendum
uh call people amendment
think really believe people state ought make decision matter kind uh - ought federal constitutional amendment would permit one fifty states make choice
uh - think responsible proper way proceed
uhh - believe also uh - merit - amendment uh - uh - senator person dirksen uh - proposed frequently  amendment would uh - change court decision far voluntary prayer public schools
uh - seems - opportunity  uh - long 's voluntary  long uh - compulsion whatsoever  uh - individual ought right
two cases think uh - uh - constitutional amendment would proper  really ' think either case 're trivial matters
think 're matters deep conviction  far many  many people country believe
therefore  shouldn ' treated lightly
're matters ah - important
two cases  would favor
ms
walters  mr
person president person
mr
person  mr
president  twice intended victim would-be assassins using handguns
yet  remain steadfast opponent substantive handgun control
forty million handguns country  going rate two point five million year
tragically  handguns frequently purchased self-protection wind used relative friend
light  remain adamant opposition substantive gun control country
mr
ford  uh - mr
person  uh - record gun control  whether 's one city another states  show registration gun  handgun  registration gun owner  way whatsoever decreased crime rate use gun committing crime
record doesn ' prove legislation action local city council effective
crux matter  make  uh - difficult person uses gun commission crime stay jail
make use gun commission
crime serious criminal offense  person prosecuted   opinion  going person uses gun wrong reason
' believe registration handguns registration handgun owner
proven effective  therefore  think better way go criminal  individual commits crime possession gun uses gun part criminal activity
people ought jail
way pass strong legislation apprehended  indicted  convicted  'll jail streets using guns commission crime
mr
person  mr
president  ' think proliferation availability handguns contributes possibility crimes committed
's second part follow-up  quickly
know 've said  jurisdictions around country strong gun-control laws
police officials cities contend national law  prevent jurisdictions providing weapons came places like location location  might better handle problem
considered analysis gu - handgun proliferation problem
mr
ford  yes
uh - individuals uh - 've consulted uh - convinced uh - national registration handguns handgun owners solve problem 're talking
person wants use gun illegal purpose get whether 's registered outlawed
obtained
people ought go behind bars
process penalize legitimate handgun owner
go process registration  effect  penalizing individual uses gun legitimate purpose
ms
walters  governor carter
mr
carter  - think 's accurate say mr
ford 's position gun control changed
uh - earlier  uh - mr
person  uh - attorney general  put forward gun control proposal  mr
ford later  believe  espoused  called prohibition uh sale aw - uh - so-called saturday night specials
would 've put uh - strict uh - uh - control owned handgun
hunter life happen shotguns  rifles  handgun
uh - purpose would see registering uh - handguns long guns kind would prohibit uh - ownership guns 've used commission crime  uh - proven mentally incompetent gun
believe limited approach - question would uh - advisable  - think  adequate
's far would go
ms
walters  mr
person governor carter
mr
nelson  uh governor  've said uh - supreme court today  uh - put  moving back proper direction uh - rulings limited rights criminal defendants
've compared present supreme court chief justice burger favorably liberal court chief justice warren
exactly getting  elaborate kind court think country
tell us kind qualifications philosophy would look president making supreme court appointments
mr
carter  governor location  although 'm lawyer  complete reform location court system
uh - streamlined structure court  put administrative officers  put unified court system  required uh - severe sentences reviewed far uniformity
addition put forward proposal adopted used throughout term office selection - judges district attorneys prosecuting attorneys  basis merit
every time vacancy location supreme court - filled five vacancies seven total half court appeals judges  number percent trial judges - given objective panel five highly qualified persons location
five  always chose first one second one
merit selection judges important single criterion
would institute kind procedure president  judicial appointments  also diplomatic appointments
secondly  think burger court fairly well confirmed major - far-reaching controversial decisions organization organization
civil rights - uh confirmed burger court  hasn ' uh - reversed  ' think 's inclination reverse basic decisions
one-man  one-vote rule  important one uh - - struck unwarranted influence legislature parsley - uh populated areas - states
uh - right indigent poor accused persons uh - legal counsel
uh - think burger court confirmed basic controversial decision organization organization
also - protection arrested person unwarranted persecution trying get false uh - confession
think couple instances burger court made technical rulings obviously guilty person later found guilty
think case uh - liberal uh - members uh - so-called person person agreed decisions
uh - thing uh - pointed  've said  need clarify technicalities couldn ' forced release person obviously guilty - small technicality law
- 's reversal position uh burger court agree
mr

last month  've net loss one hundred sixty-three thousand jobs
anybody says inflation rate good shape ought talk housewives
one overwhelming results 've seen polls people feel ' plan anymore
's way make prediction family might able home put kid college
savings accounts losing money instead gaining money
inflation robbing us
present administration - nixon 's ford 's - 've three times inflation rate experienced president person president person
economic growth less half today beginning year
housing starts - compares housing starts last year
' blame  number fewer housing starts country  fewer homes built  year since number
