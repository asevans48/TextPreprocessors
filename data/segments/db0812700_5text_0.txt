person person reduxby tristeroi must admit bit surprised amount disagreement earlier post person person
several posters asserted taken person ' rhetorical question context
read original article believe
reference  question   leaving aside practical political impossibility  could even allow contemplate liberating women children traditional islam
main points article obviously true  surely egregious abuses universal human rights many islamic islamist societies
need read person ' article know indeed  found nothing didn ' already know
also obviously true islamists strict islamic cultures worse abusers human rights marginal misc christianists fundamentalists
person saying nothing anyone serious ever disputed
believe  however  person seriously underestimates dangerous powerful america 's theocrats
people like person  person  dobson feel  present  restrained calling killing heretics  abortion providers  blasphemers `` undesirables `` due inherent tolerant impulses  none
location 's taliban advocating execution infidels oppressing women horrific level taliban  due strenuous effort americans fighting tooth nail maintain church/state separation strenuously object erosion  matter seemingly trivial
person  theocrats become ominously powerful therefore virulent
person  well-known atheist  surely deplores christianism fundamentalist christianity  quick - least article question - dismiss seriousness threat comparing islamists strict followers islam
question emphasis
far worse person ' help confusing two entirely separate issues
enough condemn specific abuses within misc communities
feels compelled condemn religion  connection doctrine islam islamist violence simply open dispute
's critics religion like speculate connection might exist  point islamists acknowledge demonstrate connection every opportunity deny retreat within fantasy world political correctness religious apology
argument specious
one denies `` connection doctrine islam islamist violence  ``
course  radical islamists quote qu ' ran texts justification
person fails appreciate highly specific exploitation certain islamic tropes symbols gain political power
however  certainly possible read texts islam ( least  translated texts ) supporting political program use violence gain power  necessary reading reading hebrew bible necessarily supports violent suppression objections misc settlements
doubt  islamism many different forms widespread  violent versions islamism major problem
person ' failure goes far beyond merely repeating everyone knows
convinced calls `` islam `` problem  fails acknowledge major factor feeding growth violent islamisms nothing qu ' ran everything catastrophe known bush/iraq war
words  person ' mistake  definition problem  piece one makes question quoted earlier post
oversimplifies `` leaves aside `` pieces complicated problem crucial understanding problem
indeed  thing `` islam `` islams - plural
lump islams together condemn aggregate inherently violent merely silly  bizarre
's like saying pedophilia scandal misc catholic church  need oppose christianities  even upright  barely-observed lutheranism location  person person ' purpose minimize human rights abuses islamic islamist societies ( crazy assume eliminated )  neither necessary  relevant  helpful concoct demon called `` islam `` inherently evil others
eliminating abuse within religion part person ' goal  also seeks elimination islam altogether  religions
since person view  islams corrupt  imaginary dangerous  grouped rubric `` islam  `` conflated islamism  aggregate loudly condemned
* * refusal address practical conflict two goals leads irresolvable intellectual incoherence
problem inherent within question quoted
goal confront specific human rights abuses within specific islamic society  counterproductive - put mildly - condemn muslim socieities general
even abuse widespread
course !
abuse may utterly horrific  reasons different
can not speak aggregate `` islam `` create effective confrontation
