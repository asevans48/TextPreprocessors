oh lord
's person person  man knack soundbites fine form
went back forth friend last night bitch ranks hierarchy slurs  since would never used polite company towards candidate whereas one occasionally gets deployed  even air  towards hillary
closest male analog prick  mean roughly thing applies ( traditionally ) one gender  threshold p-bomb seems higher b-list
prick usually guilty sort bad behavior apart aggressiveness  like boss screams front entire office ; bitch  seems  end getting tagged aggressiveness alone  like boss screams behind closed doors
given lower threshold  understand women angry/jittery seeing one slapped label tries ultimate alpha male job
even  person 's larger point every insult aimed person aimed eternal feminine ( even references women  person 's person person dig ) well taken
's crime aggressive female got ugly little label ; happened long  like sneered stay-at-home moms baking cookies started trying destroy political opponents
dare say  sort behavior man would warrant ceremonial dropping p-bomb
'd like think 's person meant  defining term explicitly terms aggressiveness added rather nuance
(  rather  rather less  )
bottom line  ' use
two clips   first person second favorite liberal wondering media types aren ' quite evenhanded slurs
admittedly  's hard imagine anyone giggling morning joe person got called prick
update  last paragraph  commenter notes bitch commonplace tv person still taboo  cut ways
fact 's gone mainstream means people may feel instinctively safer use ; question  gone mainstream
maybe real analog person
