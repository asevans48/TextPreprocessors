hits personally  sure matter happens  government `` interference `` designed help undeserving poor ( minorities ) expense hard working people like
'll say even stand line receive help failing mortgage extended unemployment benefits
difference  see  unlike parasites  work living therefore  among rich someday
( american idol dream says wealthy people got rich special worked harder anyone else - - - like  )
therefore  prerogatives rich must maintained hard workers pull boot straps became plumbing magnates
' rain parades suggesting may remain middle class americans ( global terms puts top five percent humans 've ever lived  )
