've participating aol hot seat poll months  results usually terribly surprising
since us create questions concern election  mostly results reflect partisan split
anything critical one candidate generally spur people reflect positions  number/number nation  get number/number results  usually interesting aspect state-by-state breakdowns
yesterday 's poll broke pattern interesting way
asked people answer whether person person 's broken promise use public financing made smart seizing fundraising advantage  whether made look like hypocrite principles
expected number/number result wondered whether would see anything interesting state breakdowns
instead  number % straw poll respondents thus far chosen hypocrite principles
bear mind aol hot seat poll scientific  first number votes came hot air  obviously obama territory
location  votes come organization  hasn ' shown much indication partisanship either direction history hot seat polls
organization good job limiting potential ballot-stuffing hot seat mechanism  doesn ' get gamed ( 've asked person person questions past test )
large response ( number votes ) shows question resonated voters
rather overwhelming response came across nation
location credited obama intelligence rather dishonesty
every state scolded person unprincipled reversal public financing
location  needs hold  cast almost number votes number % believed hypocrite
oregon  'll almost certainly win  cast thousand votes  number % negative
person hopes steal location  number % number straw-poll respondents think unprincipled
glow dimmed political messiah
think latest reversal may permanently crippled feeling phenomenon returned person earth another politician
unfortunately  person nothing else offer sense difference 's lost  's big  big trouble
