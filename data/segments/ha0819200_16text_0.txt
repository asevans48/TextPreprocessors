police location arrested seven taliban extremists  perhaps could forgiven believing number policemen would enough ensure security
organization showed almost battalion strength  however  police found cut
army sent battalion  terrorists kidnapped three policemen essentially captured location ( via see-dubya )  army attempt relieve rest besieged policemen  three tried escape spirited away
electricity got cut siege well
army doesn ' get quickly  rest police probably ' stand much chance survival  organization hold significant city  close location
location recently began pushing back organization  least taliban elements  due rising threat location
shows location wasn ' much wrong assessment
ability desire send force number rescue number captured members demonstrates strength creates serious security issues nwfp everywhere else location
person government blame legitimizing taliban terrorists negotiations
hopefully  new misc government learned lesson
otherwise  next city get besieged may location  involve lot number terrorists
update  taliban withdrew army arrived  hear reason siege  high-value detainees apparently location still holds
interesting
