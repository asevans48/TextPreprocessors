telegraph reports yet another great moment government-run health care today
national health service  location 's government-run health care system  finds unresponsive doesn ' trust provide care employees
instead  paid private physiotherapists treat staff rather wait nhs providers become available ( via q & o )  gee think
orwellian system like nhs would explanation make sense
order get staff back work order serve public forced use nhs fund  go outside system get medical care need quickly
given constraints status quo  actually saved british taxpayers money longer wait times
actually  person 's suggestion would cost everyone money
obviously  person misses point
real problem responsiveness isn ' nhs staff  lack competition lack resources shortage-management monopoly system
location decides many resources provide misc populace  staff another rationed resource
uk let brits keep money relied free-market health care industry  resources would grow meet demand  wait times treatment would longer issue
nhs apparently agrees assessment
used private market get resources nhs rationed near oblivion make sure didn ' lose productivity
eliminate nhs let everyone option
long uk sucks income citizens fund nhs  brits won ' realistically option
