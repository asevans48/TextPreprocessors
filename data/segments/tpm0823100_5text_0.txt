pledge president lead - - front - - reform va system make sure veterans receive respect care earned
person person scandal disgrace unworthy nation - - intend make sure nothing like ever repeated
problems well received much media attention
administration hard necessary work fixing  even press public watching
reform begins appointing secretary veterans affairs leader highest caliber  listens veterans veterans ' service organizations
va secretary must forceful advocate veterans forthright advisor  make right choices budgeting  health care  veterans ' benefit issues
also need high-energy leader   'll lot work improving service veterans
veterans must treated fairly expeditiously seek compensation disability illness

'm tell cost high paid care nation 's veterans
make sure congress funds va health care budget sufficient  timely  predictable manner
say every increase funding must matched increases accountability  va congress
requires end certain practices abuses serve neither veterans  country  reputation congress
exactly funding va programs command bipartisan support  congress like attach unrelated appropriations earmarks va bills
result mix vital national priorities wasteful often worthless political pork
earmarks show bills every kind  va bills
's end budgeting hundreds millions dollar bridges nowhere  lesser sums organization organization like
earmark million bucks fund woodstock museum didn ' come  ' imagine many veterans change vacation plans
principle simple  public money serve public good

reform doesn ' end
must also modernize disability system make sure eligible service members receive benefits quickly  based clear  predictable  fair standards
must address problems capacity access within va health care system
involve wide range initiatives  believe simple direct reform make right away
administration create veterans ' care access card used veterans illness injury incurred military service  lower incomes
card provide without timely access va facilities option using high-quality health-care providers near homes
many veterans  closest va facility isn ' close enough
many local providers already familiar common needs veterans
often  prevents receiving local care system sharing medical records among va  dod  civilian hospitals doctors
reform improve care  reduce risks  broaden access time
card intended either replace va privatize veterans ' health care  wrongly charged
believe va always provide top-quality care veterans
believe va continue provide broad-spectrum health care eligible veterans  addition specialized care areas spinal injuries  prosthetics  blindness - - services va sets standard medical care
even  veterans eligible care currently able receive  account distance  wait times  absence certain specialties
group  new card propose offer better alternatives  provide benefits earned
reform must also recognize greater care needed certain types injuries

va must also broaden care women entering armed forces greater numbers ever
growing ranks women uniform left va lagging behind services provides
veterans care access card prove especially valuable  affording women medical options va improves capacity expands services
among elements reform agenda va system
today  occasions  stated plainest  straightforward terms veterans health care access card expand existing benefits
' expect deter person campaign misrepresenting proposals  lest doubt pledge  reforms would force anyone go non-va facility
signal privatization va
replace scheduled expansion va network - - including facilities designed serve veterans living rural remote areas
suppose opponent 's vantage point  veterans concerns one issue spun worked advantage
would explain also taken liberties position gi bill
initial version  bill failed address number one education request 've heard career service members families - - freedom transfer benefits spouse child
bill also nothing retain young officer enlisted leaders form backbone all-volunteer force
political proposition  would much easier signed considered flawed legislation
people location  location  expect representatives  instead sought better bill
'm proud say result law better serves military  better serves military families  better serves interests country
one worn uniform country ever take matters lightly
learned ethic service looking one another  leaving one behind  commitment end left service
matter duty honor  whatever commitments veterans cost  president commitments kept
next president many responsibilities american people  take seriously
one responsibility outweighs others use whatever talents possess  every resource god granted protect security great good nation enemies foreign domestic
every veteran 's hope children called upon answer call arms  battle necessary field well chosen
responsibility
belongs government called
us  honor answer summons
whatever think went war location  humbled grateful example
deserve distinction best americans  owe debt never fully repay
offer small tribute humility commitment  less trying costly circumstances  help keep nation worthy sacrifice
many served multiple tours location location
many tours extended
many returned combat sooner led expect
sad hard thing ask much americans already given fair share defense country
families received news additional longer deployments without aiming appropriate complaints general direction people like  helped make decision send
shouldered rifle climbed cockpit risked everything - - everything - - accomplish mission  protect another people 's freedom country harm
privilege beyond measure live country served
good fortune know personally great many brave selfless patriots sacrificed shed blood defend location
known none braver better today
