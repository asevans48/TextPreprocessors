haven ' learned negotiating history  'll never learn
freeze people wrong
reagan-bush administration right
lehrer  governor person
dukakis  different george bush talking much sympathetically freeze spring number today
right  george  said time partisan demagoguery
nobody suggesting unilaterally disarm somehow reduce strength  course
're talking combination strong effective credible nuclear deterrent
strong  well-equipped  well-trained  well-maintained conventional forces
time willingness move forward steadily  thoughtfully cautiously
serious differences organization organization
fundamental differences human rights  democracy basic system  basic view human beings life
opportunities
senator person plan numbers beyond
mr
bush mr
quayle
want pursue plan way bring level nuclear armament  build stable peaceful world making choices home
let 's forget national security economic security go hand hand

's need democratic administration location number
( applause ) lehrer  person person  question governor
groer  yes
governor person  speaking seeming changes position  gone calling strategic defense initiative  star wars  fantasy fraud  saying recently would continue sdi research might even deploy system congress supported move
change heart
dukakis   's change heart
said beginning ought continue research strategic system level added number  's billion dollar year
' know reputable scientist believed system  least originally conceived could possibly work  notion kind astrodome could protect us enemy attack
makes real sense
matter fact  system administration talking different one originally proposed number
'm continued research  also want strong conventional forces
day  mr
bush said  well  continue star war-star wars-we cut place
hasn ' told us
know 're cutting
know 're cutting right
're cutting fiber muscle conventional forces
're cutting back maintenance equipment
air force general long ago europe said pretty soon 'd airplanes without engines  tank commanders ' drive tanks three-quarters mile  ' enough fuel
coast guard cutters tied dock summer  patrolling
're supposed first line defense drugs war drugs  ' enough fuel
make choices
're making choices
spend billions billions dollar mr
bush apparently wants  although   lot issue lately-on star wars-in judgment makes sense
need strong  credible  effective nuclear deterrent
number strategic nuclear warheads right land  sea air  enough blow soviet union forty times
number
've got move forward negotiations  get level strategic weapons
continue commit billions system makes sense think mr
bush reconsidering position course past weeks
' s-at least 's read
maybe 'll tell us stand tonight
lehrer  mr
vice president
bush  'm reconsidering position
two questions  deter nuclear attack without modernizing nuclear forces soviets modernizing come spend-willing spend dime something consider fantasy fraud
two hypo-rhetorical questions
man conventional forces wants eliminate two carrier battle groups
armed forces  conventional forces location location never ready
every single one joint chiefs testify fact readiness historic high
secondly  terms cutting coast guard  democratic controlled congress  please help us  cut $ number million coast guard interdiction effort narcotics
( applause ) bush  's got get thing clear
spend billion dollar something think fantasy fraud
fully research  go forward fast
've set levels funding deployable  deploy
position person 's never wavered bit
lehrer  person person  question governor person
jennings  well  governor  vice president person  've talked tonight hard choices
let try give one
somewhere middle east tonight  nine americans held hostage
commander-in-chief americans held hostage  important  individual fate  commitment location location government must never negotiate terrorists
americans held hostage become president  lengths would go rescue
dukakis  peter  's one agonizing decisions president make
american citizens  care deeply
families care deeply  want back understandably want everything bring back
's one thing also understand can not make concessions terrorists  ever  ever
's open invitation terrorists take hostages blackmail us
's tragedy location scandal
matter fact  mr
bush chairman task force international terrorism issued report shortly decision made said  rightly  never ever make concessions terrorists hostage takers
yet  sitting meeting meeting  endorsed decision  endorsed sale arms ayatollah exchange hostages  one tragic  one mistaken foreign policy decisions 've ever made country dare say encouraged others take hostages know
concessions circumstances  's open invitation others
've got tough international terrorism
've got treat international crime
've got attack points  've go use undercover operations
prepared use military force terrorist base camps  work closely allies make sure 're working us give quarter comes breaking back international terrorism
yes  make every effort try help hostages come home  never make concessions
tragic mistake made  mistake mr
bush made others made never ever made
lehrer  mr
vice president
bush  wrote anti-terrorist report government
best anti-terrorist report written
yes  shouldn ' trade arms hostages
made vast improvements anti-terrorism
's fine say sometimes hit base camps  president saw state sponsored-fingerprints person person loss american life  hit location
opponent unwilling support action
dukakis  's true
's true
bush  since action  terrorist action location location citizens gone
dukakis  's true
bush  long ago said supported president matter
've said mistakes made
clearly nobody 's going think president started thinking going trade arms hostages
serious charge president
matter thoroughly looked
point sometimes action - ( laughter ) bush  - taken federal government took action  favorable response
lehrer  question vice president
peter
jennings  seems perhaps good subject  mr
vice president  make point 've campaigned vigorously part leadership team
far won ' tell american people considerable measure advice gave president  including sale arms location done hostages
best knowledge 's constitutional requirement prevents
person person urged vice president  person person  tell american people
would ask president person permission tell american people advice give
'  judge judgment oval office last eight years
bush  're judged whole record
're judged entire record
closer peace
better anti-terrorism
listened opponent wanted send organization misc gulf spite mistakes past  better
credibility gcc countries western side gulf
location talking location peace
judge record
soviets coming location
look program called one marvelous boston adjective and-about angola-now  chance-several bostonians ' like  rest country understand
( applause ) bush  chance
chance
think 'd leave right say judge whole record
let say this-all talk about-he goes around ranting person
've told intelligence briefing received said
talk person person 'll make deal  take blame two incidents give half credit good things happened world peace since person person took carter administration
