congress goes recess  independence day break  members talk need get back constituents hear concerns
unfortunately  us news reports  talk
instead  travel exotic locations  costs underwritten lobbyists  cases  constituents ' afford kind travel due rising fuel costs  many politicians wives travel military jets rather commercial flights
military release costs associated junket travel  flights location  location  greece come cheaply
american taxpayers wind footing bill elected representatives  also families enjoy exotic  beautiful locations constituents enjoy national geographic channel cable tv
fact  us news reports  rising fuel prices economic uncertainty produced new trend  staycation
percentage americans planning vacations fell number % year  lowest since conference board began polling question number
' afford even modest vacations  yet representatives think little using tax money globetrotting
travel war zones obvious areas national interest makes sense
however  studying political islam require trip outside us  especially catholic nations  italy
study us-china relations need conducted resort location first days spring
jetting location study global warming almost irony
obviously  ethical congress evah needs lot reform
maybe representatives senators really spend time constituents maybe constituents replace
