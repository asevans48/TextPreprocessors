
beginning tonight 's debate bitter expect factor subplot  especially rejoinder if/when person goes shameless lying location
' afford ; 's destroying credibility public
curious thing oil nonsense 's minor issue  way instrumental campaign  yet 'll see end response ad  's still hammering away taken money oil pacs lobbyists
pac point irrelevant reason suggested hillary 's ad namely  oil industry employees raise lot bundling person lobbyist point  quote factcheck  case hair-splitting
smart thing would simply back away claim eliminate exposure  instead makes mistake made distorting person 's number years comment doubles ends getting embarrassed press
weird habit pretty darn good politician
much oil money hillary taken  ask
last check  almost $ number obama
might hear mentioned tonight
