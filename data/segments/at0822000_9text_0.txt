organization laid evidence case army scientist dr
person person
although initially doubted fbi theory dr
person sole source number anthrax attack  mused writing days ago hoped got right guy would hate think government hounded innocent man death
somewhat relived evidence provided today makes solid case
organization 's theory goes long held theory case ( also shared many  many others ) attack done organization organization
theory good evidence
'm going recap evidence provided organization available news sources
collection personal emails sent doctor undisclosed recipient period years person stark  disturbing
one email writes poem  ode mental illness
another mentions volunteered case study mental illness  seeming mock mental health
although individual elements evidence ( like sorority fixation ) may seem ludicrous  entirety evidence paints clear picture deeply disturbed man seems quite capable accused
organization affidavit includes graph shows doctor 's late night work lab
clear time prior dates two anthrax mailings  doctor atypically late lab
although notice conflict another portion affidavit ( maybe another document ) petitioner claimed evening work typical doctor
clear contradiction graph provided accurate  real smoking gun
feel certain organization finally got right man think provided invaluable service congratulated efforts
frankly  never though would solved
