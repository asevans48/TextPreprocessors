mean  literally number % world population could afford simple procedure today like removing breast cancer
could difference dying within year  living long happy life dying old age

number-number years higher education  student loans anywhere number half million
afford
seems getting rid health insurance one way trip back gilded age  handful travelling doctors ' know much kindness hearts
