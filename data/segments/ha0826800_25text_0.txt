two questions arise location post/abc poll
since find unusually high gap outlier polling kind sample produced
really show shift likely voters person person  state-by-state polling shows race tightening direction
answer poor sample still could show movement  already noted  sampling poll could explain
raw numbers  poll sample consists number % democrats number % republicans
doubles actual spread party affiliation  last surveyed more-reliable rasmussen numbernumber % -numbernumber % d-to-r
wapo/abc poll takes leaners account  spread gets even pronounced  number-number
suggests rather strong bias towards person  almost insurmountable hurdle person
location  spread smaller number/number  person two-point edge
base number gave eight-point advantage dems  nine-point advantage leaners
's seven-point shift two weeks within sample  would certainly account large shift towards person
account shift
's tougher question
seven-point shift leaners result seven-point shift  maximum  end result person lost eleven points
difference could attributable margins error built polling  could person really gain points  although eleven wapo/abc poll suggests
'll watch polling ( samples ) determine whether reflects reality pollster bias
person 's daily tracking poll obama two points first time  may movement organization still looks like anyone 's race
