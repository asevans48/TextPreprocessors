attempt german location provide outreach moderate muslims may significantly backfired  leading light becoming apostate
person person person written paper asserting prophet mohammed never existed  islam started christian heresy
needless say  people threatened death editorial cartoonists merely depicting mohammed pleased  course  christians jews dealt critical research many years historical accuracy scriptures
claims jesus  moses  person didn ' exist made  debunked  made yet often longer make news
christians jews express annoyance times claims  ' react violence rage
neither muslims  person says  reluctance even offer hypothetical amounts bigotry  agree kalisch 's response  think misplaces blame
misc intellectuals reaction massive rage comes nutcases millions muslims koran hadiths receive sort critical scrutiny
prophet cartoon outrage particularly instructive  resultant demonstrations millions participants worldwide calling death editorial cartoonists drew pictures person
's predictable rage makes western academics place muslims general category ill-tempered children
however  'd take hypothesis large  lot 's wife-sized grain salt
modern academics show little respect value oral traditions revisionist theories
's certainly possible person never existed  strikes extremely unlikely
