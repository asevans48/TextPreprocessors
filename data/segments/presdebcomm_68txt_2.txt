suggest mr
nixon way
mr
shadel  mr
vice president
mr
nixon  well welcome opportunity join senator person completely statement say largest television audience history something saying past want - always say future
last television debate  pointed position americans must choose best man either party could produce
' settle anything best
means  course  best man nation produce
means ' test religion
' test race
must test man
also far religion concerned
seen communism abroad
see
communism enemy religions ; believe god must join together
must divided issue
worst thing think happen campaign would decided religious issues
obviously repudiate klan ; repudiate anybody uses religious issue ; tolerate  ordered people nothing say - say great audience  whoever may listening  remember  believe location  want america set right example world  can not religious racial prejudice
can not hearts
certainly can not presidential campaign
mr
shadel  mr
mcgee question vice president person
mr
mcgee  mr
vice president  early campaign literature said making study see new laws needed protect public excessive use power labor unions
decided whether new laws needed    would
mr
nixon  mr
mcgee  planning speech subject next week
uh - also  get uh - opportunity questioners question  next television debate
uh - say simply  advance  believe area  laws passed uh - far big national emergency strikes concerned  ones give president weapons deal strikes
basic disagreement senator person  though  point
taken position  first indicated october last year  would even favor compulsory arbitration one weapons president might stop national emergency strike
understand last speech steelworkers union  changed position indicated felt government seizure might best way stop strike could settled collective bargaining
believe either compulsory arbitration seizure
think moment give union  one side  management  side  escape hatch eventually going government get settled  great strikes end settled government  - end  opinion  wage control ; would mean price control - things want
believe  however  give president location location powers  addition presently fact finding area  would enable effective handling strikes
one last point make
record handling good administration
less man-hours lost strikes last seven years previous seven years  great deal
want say however good record  's got better
critical year - period sixties 've got move forward  americans must move forward together  get greatest cooperation possible labor management
can not afford stoppages massive effect economy 're terrible competition 're soviets
mr
shadel  senator  comment
mr
kennedy  well  always difficulty recognizing positions 're stated vice president
never suggested compulsory arbitration solution national emergency disputes
'm opposed  opposed october  number
suggested president given weapons protect national interest case national emergency strikes beyond injunction provision taft-hartley act
' know weapons vice president talking
'm talking giving four five tools - fact-finding committee injunction provision  injunction  also power fact-finding commission make recommendations - recommendations would binding  nevertheless would great force public opinion behind
one additional powers would suggest would seizure
might others
president five powers - four five powers - limited powers today  neither company union would sure power would used ; therefore  would greater incentive sides reach agreement without taking government
difficulty president 's course quite limited
set fact-finding committee
fact-finding committee 's powers limited
provide injunction 's national emergency eighty days  strike go ; powers actions president could take unless went congress
difficult sensitive matter
state view precisely  president variety things could
could leave parties doubt one would use ; therefore would incentive  instead - steel companies ready take strike felt injunction eighty days would break union  didn ' happen
mr
shadel  next question mr
cater senator person
mr
cater  uh - mr
person  uh - senator - uh - vice president person says costed two party platforms would run least ten billion dollar year
denied figures
called supply figures
would
mr
kennedy  yes  stated uh - debates state believe balanced budget supported concept fourteen years congress
two times unbalanced budget warranted would serious recession - fifty-eight unbalanced budget twelve billion dollar - national emergency large expenditures national defense  world war ii uh - part korean war
question cost budget  stated 's best judgment agricultural program cost billion half  possibly two billion dollar less present agricultural program
judgment program vice president put forward  extension mr
person 's program  cost billion dollar present program  costs six billion dollar year  expensive history
've spent money agriculture last eight years hundred years agricultural department
secondly  believe high interest-rate policy administration followed added three billion dollar year interest debt - merely funding debt - burden taxpayers
would hope  different monetary policy  would possible reduce interest-rate burden  least billion dollar
third  think 's possible gain seven hundred million billion dollar tax changes believe would close loof - loopholes dividend withholding  expense accounts
fourthly  suggested medical care aged - bill congress passed president signed fully implemented would cost billion dollar treasury - treasury funds billion dollar states - proposal put forward many members party support medical care financed social security ; would financed social security taxes ; less three cents day per person medical care  doctors ' bills  nurses  hospitals  retire
actuarially sound
judgment would spend money administration aid education  'd spend money housing  'd spend money hope wisely defense administration
believe next administration work balanced budget  would intention
mr
nixon misstates figures constantly  uh - course right  fact matter  stand want public record
mr
shadel  mr
vice president
mr
nixon  senator person indicated several occasions program tonight misstating record figures
issue white paper broadcast  quoting exactly said compulsory arbitration  example  record show correct
far figures concerned tonight  engaging  would call  mirror game `` here-it-is-and-here-it-isn '  ``
uh - one hand  example  suggests far medical care program concerned really isn ' problem 's social security
social security tax
people pay
comes right paycheck
doesn ' mean people aren ' going paying bill
also indicates far agricultural program concerned feels cost less
well  suggest experts studied program indicate fantastic program  worst program  insofar effect farmers  - location ever foisted upon election year time
would also point senator person left part cost program - twenty-five percent rise food prices people would pay
going isn ' going help farmers
