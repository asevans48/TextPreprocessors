attempting  whether succeed  essentially build empire middle east
justify imperialistic expansion anti-colonial message -- for instance  liberation location  location  etc
- - extraordinarily effective
' know instance history anybody tried way
past misc empires always done invasion occupation
's like empire proxy  something 's hard average person understand
rcw  referred location 's ambitions empire proxy
one common arguments confronting location small country economy size location 's
country desire empire  much less attain
baer  well  would prefer proxies blackmail
fact location take control gulf 's oil resources ostensibly puts charge world 's economy
might argue american military prevent  's provided stay
need military
want put million troops region contain location police middle east
engaging iranians would difficult  action undertake could result form proxy retaliation
one measures could shutting world 's oil supply
're regime advanced capabilities guerilla warfare  extensive network blackmail unassailable message  colonized !
rcw  argue location fell iranians without single shot fired
us general person person recently took heat accusing location bribing government officials location

iranians could fight us forever location  doesn ' actually serve immediate interests
know remain patient eventually americans leave
' care even reach basing agreement
location undermine
unless 're committed placing million troops region contain empire -- as soviet empire -- the basing agreement simply won ' effect
frankly  'm sure location 's influence location overwhelming baer seems saying
certainly factions misc person person 's mahdi army nearly fully integrated person person trained location received support past
fact location weak right means iranians seek exploit divisions among shias attempt dominate future government draw forces
forces location would strenuously resist misc dominance including sunnis  secular political parties  even nationalistic shias remember misc war horrendous casualties caused
subject much discussed military foreign affairs press
seems differences opinion regarding extent current misc meddling  little disagreement location indeed seek make location puppet state point needed secular  prosperous location would allow independent factions resist
baer 's analysis misc intentions otherwise spot
