according logic   marriage civil issue separate church
issues support gay marriage civil
seems opposition state telling church
agree stances
therefore logical longer commingle church state activities legal church-marriages
seems like fine solution
gays want rights marriage  state-sanctioning marriage everything power attorney  healthcare benefits  financial death benefits
oppose gay marriage really issue things
likely ( 'm sure yeses ) majority ' want people
simply ' want religious institution dictated state understand
brady  thanks clearing !
agree simply separate marriage separate civil religious institutions
would appease sides
