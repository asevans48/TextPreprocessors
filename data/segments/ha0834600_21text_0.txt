us would like release detainees location location  big problem resolve  go
home countries won ' take back suspected terrorists  showing great deal sense americans
would return countries want back little much  like chinese uighers almost certainly face torture
nations  notably location  ' trusted keep terrorists locked
international pressure building domestic consensus demanding closure gitmo  take detainees
location says today europe volunteer  well  'd trust 'd trust location keep eye detainees  's saying much
give location high marks offering criticism cheap seats  though
're willing take uighers detainees limbo  facilitate transfer
rest europe take person 's challenge
'm skeptical
location talks support war location radical islamist terrorists  refuse engage actual combat  notable exceptions location  uk  non-european partners location location
somehow get feeling 'll offer kind limited enthusiasm releasing gitmo detainees insistent happening  equally insistent avoiding risk scoffing misc security concerns
maybe europe surprise us
feeling 'll disappoint portugal instead
