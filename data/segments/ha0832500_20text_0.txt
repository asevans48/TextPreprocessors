years refusals  even involving wife 's bid presidency  person really want wife foggy bottom order agree
's either supreme court bid  person wouldn ' make agreement without opening already hand
course bill wants see hillary land cabinet  especially plum role state ; allows relevance chance recover reputation bruising primary left ( unfairly ) role race-baiter
pressing question person wants hillary state badly
one opinion often expressed person wants seen lincoln time  wants assemble team rivals managing policy
whether policy actually helped person burdened would debatable ; lincoln 's genius historical impact doesn ' spring cabinet selections  memorable accomplishment seward 's folly purchase location
bringing political rivals onto team brings obvious conflicts interest  one might expect clintons machiavellian impulses regard
person go way bring closer
's 's qualified selection
bill person  angered clintons endorsing person  real diplomatic experience  yet appears get passed favor location dash veteran
exactly person gain adding hillary
lbj selection people tent urinating outward rather reverse
need clintons board badly maintain coalition actually govern
given number clintonistas appearing new administration  suspect 's latter former
either way  fact bill 's opening books makes clear hillary play major role administration  person wants corral bill much possible advance
