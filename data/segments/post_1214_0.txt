offense  reading history bit mistaken
communal societies may existed  make communist
idea evolved overtime  concepts states  corporations  human rights could idea like communism invented person marx
fascism way
fascism necessarily authoritarian  though used interchangeably solely aspect popular culture
fascism also includes economic component  one government exerts control privately help businesses partial ownership
simple complete ownership industry communism  result government direction industry many cases
could evolved without concepts state  corporations  human rights  etc  developed last hundred years
racism actually idea `` tribal group nation `` superior others
racism distinctly race
europeans  example  usually race thinking tribe superior european tribes centuries
since human ability circumnavigate globe come contact distinct races people concept racism evolved today
idea one tribe superior another race could evolved individuals never ran individuals separate races regular basis
point moral progress made along material progress  shown  lot moral ideas come along progress
marxian idea `` progress  `` many individuals exhibit almost religious faith  dangerous humanity
thinking every moral idea must superior last  thinking inevitably end earth `` better place  `` dangerous way think
every idea  every charismatic leader  leads us `` better place  ``
consequences ideas long run can not always known  simple exercise thinking beyond emotions immediate consequences usually lead us sound understanding
