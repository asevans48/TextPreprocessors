begin  following reminder order  biology  evolution change inherited traits population organisms one generation next
changes caused combination three main processes  variation  reproduction  natural selection

org/wiki/evolutioni suppose reply attempt rebut assertions  `` bare mind homosexuals adhere theory evolution must also necessarily adhere principle theory posits propagation fittest sexually reproductive species ; consequently damned homosexual  homosexual doesn ' propagate species  ``
; reply favor  `` homosexuals pass genes directly  however many studies shown may make reproduction likely siblings
fact  prevalence homosexuality species makes fairly obvious homosexuality among portion population  must beneficial survival species whole
addition  studies humans shown people older brothers likely homosexual
problem argument look evolution simplistic perspective
evolution works helping individual survive  however organisms reproduce sexually  species evolve groups
therefore characteristic allows group survive passed
definitive proof homosexuality one characteristics  possibility strong one
response  consider consequences supporting oppositions argument
homosexuality consequence evolution consequence purpose survival species ; homosexuality benefit survival group species
immediately infer evolution removed homosexual genetically contributing species
thus  genetics homosexual conducive survival species  destructive survival species
therefore  answer question  evolution excludes certain individuals genetic contribution species homosexuality survival group survival species
furthermore  evolution eliminated certain genetic consequences genetically multiplying members species
also infer groups species beneficiaries homosexuality individuals group
author implying order sexual reproduction propagate species effectively  certain individuals must homosexual others homosexual
author invalidly reasons  fact  prevalence homosexuality species makes fairly obvious homosexuality among portion ( human ) population  must beneficial survival species whole
either author attempting insult intelligence audience debate guilty granting unreasonable
( dont think author intentionally either one  unintentionally accomplishes  )
reason according example author arrive interesting conclusions
example  prevalence inbreeding species makes fairly obvious inbreeding among portion ( human ) population must beneficial survival species whole
prevalence cannibalism species makes fairly obvious cannibalism among portion ( human ) population must beneficial survival species whole
prevalence random breeding species makes fairly obvious random breeding among portion ( human ) population must beneficial survival species whole
prevalence vomit consumption species makes fairly obvious consumption vomit among portion ( human ) population must beneficial survival species whole
prevalence butt-licking species makes fairly obvious butt-licking among portion ( human ) population must beneficial survival species whole
certain things true many species doesnt allow man woman validly infer true another species
called layman terms  jumping conclusions
reread carefully consider assertions original argument re-posted  see assertions subjective behalf proponents evolution
propositions indicate inescapable conclusions theory supports
assert theory evolution accounts known processes lifes continuity
suggest one embrace theory
simplistically explained consequences supposed complexity theory evolution
demonstrated wherein reference evolution  reduce supposed complexity subject theory evolution simple illogical conclusions
reason troubled accusation view evolution simplistically
( albeit  argument particular  yet accused universal argument  )
another issue must address  accused neglecting  matter social contributions made homosexuals  tangible intellectual
whether homosexual person made tangible intellectual contribution enabled/s survival species purely fallacious
speculations one person done conclusively contributed survival destruction species fallacy  argumentum ad speculum
indefinitely speculate hypothetical reasoning may
yet  conclusive evidence would lend scrutiny sound reasoning concludes member  group species necessary cause consequence of/for survival death species  speculate obvious
speculate would ignorant law gravity person person never born
speculate alive today knowledge
yes  speculate anything  can not rationally speculate unto definitive conclusion reasonably useful
one last thing end rebuttal ; rebuttals explain wherefore propositions
rebuttals hand evidence nothing supports argument
arguments seem always come form either straw-man  ad hominem  red-herring fallacy
fact  argument rebuttals
simply assert whatever think ad populum
little advice  unwillingly take time support case  suggest forego rebutting arguments someone take time
however  welcome legitimate attempts support views contrary contradictory arguments
