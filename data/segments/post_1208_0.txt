barely anything gays frankly  every attempt change definition traditional marriage american society met attempt stop
issue marriage  defined union one man one woman  kept way good society
location wasn ' allowed union changed incorrect definition marriage location location
think marriage one man one woman  especially regards raising children  ideal society
make difference child two mothers instead mother father

difference caucasian man asian man cosmetic difference
huge differences men women
girl scouts boy scouts  white scouts asian scouts
society able differentiate laws regarding different things  gays currently right marry someone opposite sex everyone else
gays ' choose genetic/nature/nurture/biological differences
allowing equal rights visitation  inheritance  etc obviously law  currently law many cases contracts individuals  made

case  rational argument one could make grouping consensual  loving humans joining together `` marriage  `` including polygamy intra-family marriage  definition true
hope helps  appreciate discussion
main goal merely least get others think steps beyond initial emotionality issue

thinking past `` stage number  `` though people  imperative understanding issue
thinking consequences wrought children taught school ideal marriage relationships  consequences men women marriage becomes arrangement one pleases  denying differences value men women child-rearing vast consequences unknowable
making momentous change society thought  least voted behind banner little well-thought `` prop hnumber `` `` equal rights  ``
