would rather allow law abiding students chance protecting criminals various crimes assault  rape murder fact small chance accident
firearm accidents incredibly rare someone getting injured firearm accident even rarer
even federal government states firearms used number million times year self defense
also statement guns campus completely fallacy  guns campus incidents vtech niu prove criminals wont follow law cops cant everywhere protect everyone
mention thought cops shouldnt allowed campus carry firearms could accidentally shoot someone
