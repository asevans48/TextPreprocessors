's buzz morning hewitt 's spin closer truth
ambinder notes  person 's got devil 's triangle shaping location  huck pull evangelical social cons  person pull hawks independents ( get skip democratic race person 's ballot )  leaves mitt person person conservative vote
enough location win
'm skeptical  numbers amazingly close  believe  except one typically crappy arg outlier poll september  gop candidate exceeded much number percent since february
one 's got even much number percent rcp average  last four polls taken  one 's topped number percent big three winning least one polls
mitt craters  's  right
reasons best explained short shrewd person person column
long two anti-hucks competing primary  split vote give person fighting chance win build momentum
money organization  person may hang super ultra mega tuesday hope 'll anti-huck left standing base choice line behind
problem person 's likely left standing ; like person says  huck may actually want lose rudy location simply guarantee participation big tuesday
three still come location  pressure third-place finisher get make tuesday head-to-head simplify things anti-huck voters tremendous
needless say  person person person location really left serial loser mitt great hope  's going historic fiasco
exit question  assuming mitt get  endorse
huck person seem hate 's tangled rudy somewhat nasty ways debates
ain ' throwing endorsement away organization ' fred either
would politely decline endorse anyone
make deal frontrunner kind cabinet position
