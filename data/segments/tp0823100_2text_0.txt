person claims tire inflation lines big oil 's pockets last night fox news  host person person former house speaker person person ( r-ga ) returned ( often ) sen
person person 's ( d-il ) recent suggestion americans inflate tires properly order save energy costs
seeming outdo previous false attacks issue  person claimed person 's idea actually encouraging americans enrich big oil selling air higher profit margin selling gasoline  gingrich  well  got funny e-mail retired military officer tampa pointed tire inflation done service stations pay
's actually higher profit margin selling gasoline
sen
person urging go enrich big oil inflating tires instead buying gas
watch  claim absurd number reasons
first  gas station owners  big oil  receive profits selling air sell air ( presumably mechanized air machines )
second  air free
course profit margin selling air going higher gallon gas
contrast  cost oil accounts significant portion price gasoline
profits gasoline sales ( actually quite small ) also go gas station owners  big oil already paid
beyond gingrich 's ridiculous assertion  auto alliance noted maintaining proper tire pressure important may think saves fuel reduces costs greenhouse gases
indeed  gov
person person ( r-ca ) gingrich praised one great winners person agrees
today endorsed thrust person 's idea  saying person reduce fuel costs number %
talking simple things  like proper tire pressure  avoiding rapid starts stops  keeping engine tuned
