organization appears serially caved-in global warmist activism
much online discussion weekend friday organization global warming / la nina related article suddenly changing wording - - apparent balance
today  news eco-activist smugly taken credit coercing change joined conversation
'm adding discovery second amending neutrality-vital sentence survived first update completely vanished
original piece organization news environment analyst person person opened words `` global temperatures year lower number  ``
day 's end lede 's start changed `` global temperatures drop slightly year  ``
versions included third line  `` would mean global temperatures risen since number  prompting question climate change theory  ``
original followed  `` experts also forecast record high temperature within five years  probably associated another episode el nino  ``
updated version read  `` experts say still clearly long-term warming trend - - forecast new record high temperature within five years  ``

organization [ sic ]  us space agency  cites number warmest year  uk 's person centre lists second number  ``
researchers say uncertainty observed value particular year larger small temperature differences
matters  say  long-term upward trend  ``
prompted discussion-altering edit  - - way - - neglected update post 's timestamp
morning  person person location 's institute public affairs  revealed exchange author climate alarmist jo abbess found campaign climate change message board
seems cacc board abbess posted transcript email debate order impress fellow greenies
apparently unhappy article 's emphasis natural forces  abbess demanded `` correction `` typical alarmist grounds
first  countered statements person made laughably unsubstantiated claims
's taste first  `` several networks exist question whether global warming peaked  contain actual scientists  scientists contain climate scientists expertise area  ``
quickly moved another gorebot favorite tactic statements likes  `` think 's counterproductive even hint earth cooling  ``
`` issue debate '
issue emerging truth  ``
harrabin countered abbess 's arguments demanded `` correction `` article exactly twice latter pulled big guns - ad hominem  `` would ask  please reserve main bbc online channel emerging truth
otherwise  would conclude insufficiently educated able know psychologically manipulated
would make unreliable reporter  ``
threats  `` send comments others contribution  unless request
likely want post comments forums/fora  please indicate want happen
may appear unfavourable light could said head turned sceptics  ``
organization news environment analyst obediently responded  `` look number minutes tell happier
changed headline  ``
believe - - change
would appear enough make abbess  perhaps fellow eco-maniac  `` happier  ``
returned organization site  'm amazed report yet another drastic change -  original `` last update `` timestamp intact - - piece
besides offering third version location  time opening `` global temperatures number slightly cooler last year  `` crucial sentence - mitigated first update - - removed altogether  `` would mean global temperatures risen since number  prompting question climate change theory  ``
sentence modified friday diminish impact flat mean temperature phenomenon reported     replaced single statement  `` year 's temperatures would still way average - - would soon exceed record year number global warming induced greenhouse gases  ``
original 's opened door reasoned debate  opening paragraphs latest rendition purposely slam door shut
coincidentally  abbess demanded certain things made clear `` first paragraphs  ``
morphing article 's tenor dialogue lecture minimum extorted word processing
wonder mr
harrabin appreciates irony done
particularly partly response suggestion `` insufficiently educated able know [ ] psychologically manipulated `` might make `` unreliable reporter  ``
exactly compelled recent odious change
abbess  confided fellow alarmists first update might `` much better  ``
person 's cowardly capitulation open door eco-copy-cats skewed facts intimidation
either way  one journalism 's proudest moments
