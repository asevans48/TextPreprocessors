recent blog misc thinker theauthor mulls idea person could move position current race based affirmative action program  support replacing class-based affirmative action program
seen suggestion modification put forward increasing regularity  often put  `` shouldn ' help rich black kids  help poor kids matter race ``
person strongly disagree notion  advance anominally conservative publication `` class based `` affirmative actionis better  orless objectionable current system
fact far worse
first let us return original justification affirmative action  society needs make group  initially blacks  ancestors mistreatment society whole
case blacks  includes enslavement
thus current aa system isat least nominally grounded historical fact
sadly aahasnowgrown include groups dubious historical claims maltreatment  least original case logic
logic applies using power state favor poor middle class
inevitably supports leftist intellectual tradition says poverty societies fault  becomes yet another part endlessly increasing culture welfare payments dependency
conservatives used stand opposed notions  deride `` cultural marxism ``
fact hard imagine perfectly marxist notion favoring children poor admissions qualified children middle class
person signature hated communist regimes person 's pol pot 's raise `` peasant `` class bourgeoisie
leaving aside people administer programs going people administering current race based system  likely use reward exactly people  would favoring  say  black kid ghetto whose motherlives welfare black kid suburbs whose mother registered nurse
consider second two mothers sisters  sharedand identical upbringing
one worked hard achieved middle class existence  made series poor choices finds living poverty
person child poor mom preference child successful mom
absurdity systemshould self evident
person creates perverse system rewards failure part parents
basic economics tells us get reward
consider also society allows massive immigration children immigrants nearly always less well children long established families
`` class based `` aa system children immigrants would mostly given preference children citizens
odd system punishes people worked whole life pay state schools new arrivals step front line
traditional american system families working ladder success several generations implies  requires  benefit accrue things like working harder  moving better neighborhoods  sending kids better elementary high schools
ability get better colleges enhanced
person always closer get meritocracy things better hard working  society awhole
conservatives supposed believe american tradition hard work  level playing field  supporting family good members
might imagine day bringing race-based affirmative action end  based reasoning x number generations blacks gotten leg time compete nose nose  seems possibility ending class based aa begun
reasons `` class based `` affirmative action worse abomination race based version claims superior  vigorously opposed thinking americans
