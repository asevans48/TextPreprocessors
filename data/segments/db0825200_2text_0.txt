ad warsby ddayi kind person gets excessively worried poll poll  think person campaign strategy getting vote significantly different  aren ' pollwatching either
think cries `` person needs x `` aren ' something presume really know better next guy
's clear campaign actually trying hit back media message - really  send number-number news releases day  hitting right spots - great extent game rigged ( see msnbc demotions today )
absolutely agree concerned campaign ads poor  say someone works living creative media
's ' attack mccain ' tie bush ; 's question style
even ones done credible job content perspective innovative  getting bogged statistics one-line shibboleths ( `` protecting economy `` ) pass contemporary policy debate  instead offering vision compelling storyline number seconds
'm completely opposed presenting factual information ( `` person overturn roe `` ad fine )  person appealing candidate unappealing advertising
olympics ad showed time-lapse footage house built metaphor getting country back track start  stock images house-building  reveal finished house end wasn ' long enough  completely ruined
's perfect example over-cautious wedded old ways political ads campaign  even primaries ( exceptions )
creatively spots dead
often say right things wrong way  imo
campaign cut clutter
nate silver couple ideas  one like
final night democratic convention location  person campaign seven eight ' ordinary ' people speak assembled crowd invesco field
working class  middle-aged white hispanic voters  conveniently happened swing states
actually pretty persuasive  produced moving moments convention  would put together five six spots  featuring people people like speaking directly camera  interspersed images hometowns families  reserving number seconds end phrases blackscreen  `` obama economic plan `` `` tax cuts working families `` `` number million new green energy jobs `` `` health care every american `` `` change need `` get idea
's little unconventional would buzzworthy would seek counter person 's homespun appeal
' agree word blobs end  could surely entertaining appealing way
reinforces message campaign ordinary people
failing  think one best things feature barack
's best message originator  riffs makes campaign trail scream number-second television ads
instead talk camera spot  replay one riffs
example  one today
effect actually offering passion message
's passion ads right
're largely litany
another possibility piece cut internally organization  could made number number-second spot
emotional appeal  positive way push back `` community organizing `` slur
level understand campaign running away `` movement `` messaging general election  think 's mistake
turnout motivating base crucial  something like could successful
lastly  could get core message sen
person ways go beyond citing statistics list policies
fit something actually storyline  like anti-norm person ad dscc  number ways go
liberals creative community side campaign isn ' putting use  numbers defunded
everyone talks person campaign reawakened spirit take country back put us better path
wouldn ' know right ads
update  soon wrote  noticed new ad  somewhat better  least music little jarring  graphics totally standard
overall  however  criticism stands
tell story
go omniscient voice
add passion
