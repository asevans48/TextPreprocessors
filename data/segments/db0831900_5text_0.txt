demand-side economicsby ddayrobert reich  'm glad room advising president-elect person transition  written piece calls `` mini-depression `` best undo
first thing understand nature problem
first  understand main problem right supply credit
yes  wall street paralyzed moment bursting housing asset bubbles means lenders fearful creditors won ' repay loans
even credit flowing  loans wouldn ' save jobs
businesses want borrow remain solvent keep creditors bay
fail  creditors push reorganization bankruptcy  'll cut payrolls  sure
're already cutting payrolls
's far clear 'd cut jobs bankruptcy reorganization 're already cutting pressure avoid bankruptcy remain solvent
means bailing wall street auto industry insurance industry housing industry may help satisfy creditors time put day reckoning  industry bailouts won ' reverse downward cycle job losses
real problem demand side economy
consumers won ' ' borrow 're end ropes
incomes dropping ( one sobering statistics friday 's jobs report continued erosion real misc earnings )  're deeply debt  're afraid losing jobs
introductory economic courses explain aggregate demand made four things  expressed c+i+g+exports
c consumers
consumers cutting back everything necessities
spending accounts number percent nation 's economic activity flywheel rest economy  precipitous drop consumer spending causing rest economy shut
investment
absent consumer spending  businesses going invest
exports won ' help much rest world sliding deep recession
( foreigners - - well americans - - put savings dollar safe keeping  value dollar likely continue rise relative currencies
turn  makes everything might sell rest world expensive  )
leaves g   course  government
government spender last resort
government spending lifted america great depression
may instrument lifting america mini depression
even fed chair person person calling sizable government stimulus
knows monetary policy won ' work 's inadequate demand
doesn ' mean ' bail auto companies  focus efforts demand side equation
use government create jobs raise income  consumer spending rise  investment rise  etc
saving auto industry might part -  carmakers parallel industries employ number million people
meet scope problem 're going much - probably spending number % gdp
paradoxically  're going spend things work cross purposes selling inefficient automobiles ; things like transportation infrastructure
answer second question mostly `` infrastructure `` - - repairing roads bridges  levees ports ; investing light rail  electrical grids  new sources energy  energy conservation
even conservative economists like organization 's person person calling government stimulate economy infrastructure spending
infrastructure projects like pack double-whammy  create lots jobs  make economy work better future
( important qualification  correctly avoid pork  federal government need capital budget lists infrastructure projects order priority public need  )
government also spend health care child care
expenditures also double whammies    create lots jobs  fulfill vital public needs
auto industry bailout must tied fuel economy  otherwise  're funding new  fast  efficient means transport would reduce greenhouse gas emissions old model number mpg gas guzzlers
person person said yesterday votes aren ' auto industry bailout lame duck session congress
guarantees efficiency made  think votes could january
big emphasis new energy economy
' better way reindustrialize america jobs ' shipped away
know believe industrial output rising due productivity  go numbers holds among couple sectors - basically  wasn ' computer would hardly industrial output
building new energy grid transmit wind solar power anywhere location location  building high speed rail runs clean electricity  building new renewable facilities  create jobs spur demand  raise wages giving job-seekers option outside dead-end service sector
fact organization rightly blocked new production coal-fired power plants makes practical necessity
yes  health care part
hastily dismissed talk adding health care stimulus package yesterday
person says  's double whammy - create jobs  fulfill public needs
reich finishes pre-empting neo-hooverist argument  expect two sorts arguments
first come fiscal hawks claim government already spending way much
even without new stimulus package  next year 's budget deficit could run trillion dollar  given amounts spent bailing wall street perhaps auto industry  providing extended unemployment insurance measures help direct need
hawks argue nation ' afford giant deficits  especially baby boomers years away retiring claiming social security medicare
're wrong
government spending puts people back work invests future productivity nation exactly economy needs right
deficit numbers significance
pertinent issue much underutilized capacity exists economy
's lots idle capacity  deficit spending entirely appropriate  person person person taught us
moving economy fuller capacity shrink future deficits
second argument come conservative supply-siders call income-tax cuts rather spending increases
'll claim individuals money pockets get economy moving readily government
're wrong  three reasons
first  income-tax cuts go mainly upper-income people tend save rather spend
americans pay payroll taxes income taxes
second  even rebate could fashioned  people tend use extra dollar pay debts rather buy new goods services  witnessed months ago government sent rebate checks
third  even individuals purchase goods services  purchases tend generate many american jobs government spending total scale much consumers buy comes abroad
number years supply-side economics  gotten us precisely crisis
shifting job creation wage increases  demand-side economics  would maybe quiet revolution cable news gasbags focus personality  revolution nonetheless
