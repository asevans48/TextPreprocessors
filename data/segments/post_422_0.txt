first  entire argument nothing assertion - - claim profits positively affect cost quality health care title  provide actual evidence article claim
support given single article  citation given  claims nonprofit hospitals charge  evidence profits good system
( since 's impossible know article 're referring  way check data reporters used make sure 're making right comparisons drawing correct inferences ; 's even possible verify wsj article actually backs position  )
let 's accept unsupported statement profits positive effect moment
even granting  article undercuts relevance larger discussion statement  `` thus  lot profits still made single-payer systems  lot nonprofits us system  ``
near tell ( since article poor job relating broader discussion )  point made system health care good allows profits  positively affects health care
quote  see single-payer system also allows profits  conclude also positively affects health care
way article supposed support ' ' side universal health care argument
accept everything written unquestioningly  still end reason come one side debate
