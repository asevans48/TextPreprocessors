party crashers digbyapparently person person intrigued ( concerned ) bunch 's characterization liberal bloggers eschacon `` declaring war `` press
find interesting since  far 'm concerned  liberal bloggers declared war press many years ago
'm sure even controversial
pushing back biased  anti-democrat pro-republican lies editorial judgment supposed one primary raison d ' etres
person seems think discussion unusually provocative  actually wasn '
said press love person  dangerous democrats needed work hard combat  starting democrats still settling primary
( bunch wrote piece  october way late  )
said bloggers could get `` personal ugly `` ways institutions like media matters couldn '  wasn ' suggesting `` take culture war next level de-legitimate media many people reach  ``
's hyperbole nobody even came close saying
going personal ugly  meant could write press way excerpt post person positively quotes length
words  write like bloggers  laying critique edgy  irreverent  aggressive terms organization like media matters would want
( new organizing tools may make possible drill national critique state local level mobilize readers take writers  )
informality shoot-from-the-hip style  along outsider status freedom  essence blogging
better case post  would ridicule blogosphere whole dished video person press bar-b-que location found way youtube
`` personal ugly `` simply showing fawning media schmoozing favorite flyboy ( garnering two glowing accounts location post day  )

story relentlessly flogged cable gasbags  justified heavy breathing rationale bill habit catting around  marital bed newsworthy since wife running president
indeed  responsible speculate often person 's sex  would irresponsible
unlike clinton rules say one tiny detail story proven factual entire story taken gospel  person rules say opposite
fact alleged affair person iseman proven means rank hypocrisy campaign finance ties lobbyists never mentioned
village hissy fit ( mccains self-righteous performance ) sufficient cow news organization going
person brings fact colleague panel question  ntodd  said people asking organization clinton person lewinsky people asking person circumstances marriage

even  according organization organization law  's ``  `` doesn ' even matter 's true - - - people would talking
right wing gets things ether

people ' know person 's marital history press hands
gasbags village pearl clutchers able claim iseman story wasn ' newsworthy chastise person person person new york times democrats impunity person person ilk every day repulsive sideshows
' particular desire know politicians sleeping idea information sort great window character qualifications job ( particularly criticism coming promiscuous celebrity playboys ) laughable
going ( sign aren ' ) least expect equal opportunity busybodies show hypocrisy toward politicians personally like well ones loathe  ``
fair balanced `` scandalmongering isn ' particularly edifying  's better yet another decade open season democratic presidential candidates
person believes chance press chastened behavior number see absolutely evidence ever looked fundamental issues underlying attachment person - - - simple-minded attraction macho warrior bonafides  assumptions political courage based upon record physical bravery number years ago famously bad tempered iconoclasm  phony clubbiness
give pass like
like pretends like
fact person 's `` openness `` results boys bus protecting improvement person person 's mindless gotcha questions blatant hostility politicians find `` boring `` `` cold  ``
person brings one episode find revealing  person person  person said couldn ' stop [ talking reporters ]  person destroys credibility
besides  said  person enjoy lot

person supposed chuckle insult  towel-snapping part affairis really much ask relationship press powerful based upon healthy mutual skepticism ( even begrudging ) respect others ' jobs rather boys locker room experiences
seems worked last round  apparently `` person person `` campaign ( talk dynasties ) going reported much way bush ii - - - organization bar-b-q assorted useless stupidities substituting journalism
person thinks possibly change person may match person `` radical openness `` press
's possible  course  person 's closed press candidates parties ( considering success far  would suggest 's worked  )
stories like  begin surface  see critical narrative building around failure
number reasons 's escaped normal democratic coverage far  least media obsessively diverted complicated  long standing relationships clintons person person  play soap opera stirring warrior tales written long ago
doesn ' take anything away senator person  foxnews decided needed get game  managed finesse quite successfully
( managing press corps skill wouldn ' ever take granted
's big selling point person book  )
history shows love affairs dems tend last long press corps isn ' getting fed kind juicy  tabloid style gop spin points find irresistible  time slammed mercilessly operatives tank
reverend wright brouhaha example expect - - - point obama start receiving onslaught tough press

person quotes person person  one co-authors `` free ride `` person 's relationship media  saying 's hopeful book help persuade reporters take step back ask whether coverage person
book impressive perhaps press read epiphany
person points  rightwing babblers hate mccain
circumstances  press conventions dictate person hated hot right cold left - - - person 's right
person becomes man middle  precious political commodities
( loves  really loves ! )
judging 'm seeing campaign far  press hasn ' spent even one minute reassessing campaign coverage past couple decades mindlessly running repetitious ( long ago discredited ) plot lines
younger ones ' even know much right wing cant 've internalized older ones still trying justify previous bad behavior
look press coverage bill person  person person  's obvious republican narratives dominate get going
( 's opinion primary go actually good thing - - republicans ' settle single story line  )
assume time different try get front attack stuff head  right
person wants us declare war  rather try persuade
seems matter semantics tactics
desperately want persuade stop ninnies jackasses way 've seen relentlessly pointing foibles mobilizing public hold accountable
wake tomorrow begin reporting race way doesn ' seem come junior high slumber parties boy scout camp  couldn ' happier
think would foolish count
person interesting ideas go making coverage person better end article worth considering
( would surprised person would allow liberal bloggers back bus suspect press corps wouldn ' like much either
would likely spoil party  )
update  make clear 'm criticizing person observations
disagree assumptions possibility change press corps ' behavior election  's wrong ask questions
believe bloggers pointing incorrect reporting isn ' enough
media matters better us
independent bloggers connect dots aggression attitude
