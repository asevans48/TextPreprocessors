flaw logic think health insurance best cheapest way provide health care
health care insurance means paying ( doctors  hospital 's overhead  etc
also paying ) everyone else works insurance company
company 's business make money
money could go towards actual health care instead insurance 's pockets
lets follow logic see leads
people ' require health care every day
require food every day
since inhumane let people go hungry  nationalized meals every citizen ( roast every pot )
need people place collect money distribute money  etc
'll call nutrition insurance group ( nig )
need get paid services money coming
oh yeah  people
cost money feed amount people pay nig
problem  cut back rations ( 're fat anyway ) quality food
people get used idea nig  raise price food  `` ' worry
insurance take care  ``
( literally told doctor wanted perform considered questionable procedure
adamant necessary mentioned insurance  )
leave ( conserve ) ( call conservatives )
pan handler get least $ number day get number happy meals person person 's ; )  ' hate poor
hate fact forced provide
poor people either provide force liberals provide ( without help conservatives ; )
