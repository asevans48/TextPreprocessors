person person person person 's winding write something  attended screening `` milk `` last night put together courage campaign  wanted give thoughts
( though 's familiar story  spoilers  )
film superb
wasn ' sure could reach heights excellent person person documentary `` times person milk  `` winner best documentary oscar number  got close
use archival footage location shooting entirely location location ( used exact storefront recreate milk 's `` person camera `` shop became hangout/political office time ) gives vrit quality  performances first-rate natural
person person 's performance milk ascendant  reflecting persistence joy well human frailty
milk closet number  denial self ( `` haven ' done one thing 'm proud `` ) propelled live rest life perpetual motion machine  constantly engaged activism
pushed orbit come  show  claim rights take back democracy  saying `` 'll vote us number number know one us  ``
yet one first political acts undertakes setting shop location location 's castro neighborhood partnering teamsters boycott coors beer refusing sign union contract
eventually  successful boycott  teamsters began hire openly gay truck drivers
milk activist part movement human rights  also pretty shrewd political actor
