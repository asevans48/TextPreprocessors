didn ' sleep much last night  already feeling queasy tuned watch bit good morning america interview person person 's good family friend  bill ayers
'm really feeling sick stomach
interviewer actually adequate job trying press ayers terrorist past
end  acquiesced let ayers last  morally equivalent word
( allah 's got vid clips deconstruction  )
ayers refused say violent crimes weather underground wrong
talked domestic terrorism akin toilet-papering neighbor 's tree
magnanimously acknowledged organization bombings crossed lines propriety  legality  perhaps common sense
perhaps
confronted prairie fire manifesto 's dedication person person  waved quick reject
asked number/number quote organization lamenting terrorist outfit done  ayers whinnied quote taken context number people killed vietnam
huh
ayers adamantly denied weather underground engaged terrorism didn ' target people kill injure
oh  yeah
tell families person person  person person person  person person
suggested yesterday fox families offered equal time rebut ayers ' self-whitewashing
equal time
