journalists made much effort acknowledge ( ) organization mostly misc origin anyway afghan face popular support
organization formed ( minimum ) acquiescence benazeer person protect misc trade routes location way misc government gain influence unstable internecine warfare misc misc deposed communist government
pushing afghan base tactical victory  strategic one
said strategic victory impossible conditions time ; long location retreat  could never completely defeated
left obvious way forward us strategy war terror

horse 's mouth  adnkronos  spokesman afghan taliban  person person  said person location location  afghan organization  separated tehrik taliban location leader person person
andin exclusive interview adnkronos international ( person ) unknown location  person said misc taliban fighting us  allied forces occupied location  two taliban groups allies
said since person tribal militants border region started fighting location 's armed forces  afghani taliban cut ties openly disowned
words  organization organization affiliated taliban location wants overthrow person ( establish islamic government ) split afghanistan based organization
makes sense look way
afghan organization probably become purely afghan populated taliban
organization organization shifted location number  organization organization organization core leadership longer needed afghan tribes secure
time  location organization lost focus location  whereas afghan organization still sees fight homes
location  focus jihad take location  political jihad unlike `` defensive jihad `` location

person 's recognizes  numerous theories put forward explain person person 's dismissal  increasingly close relationship organization real reason  according senior foreign official location spoke person 's
high mid-level taliban commanders contacted person 's little respect person
said promoted attempt safeguard brother 's networks face-saving exercise mitigate psychological blow person person 's death
dismissal ineffective commander unlikely weaken insurgency  highlighted divisions within organization
organization increasingly split follow old leadership take cue organization
taliban separated pro-al qaeda anti-al qaeda factions  splitting regionally
despite person 's claim may weaken  weakens taliban-al qaeda alliance attacked location location number/number
crippled susceptible fighting  inter-tribal warfare
groups become isolated  fight even harder  fighting self-preservation rather ideology
mistake increased fighting increased capability
case mark desperation
organization desperate avoid inevitable outcome  fully carved small factions fighting along tribal lines  acquiesce legal location government
soon organization organization leadership rely taliban questionable loyalties makes environment ripe betrayal
surely  one taliban groups come consider organization organization leadership bargaining chip political situation deteriorates
