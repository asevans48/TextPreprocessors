penalty insurance person $ number  's actually cheaper pay fee pay insurance
know individuals paid penalty rather spend actual coverage
find incredibly depressing
socialist countries location incredibly expensive average person pays number % his/her paycheck taxes  look danes  're healthy well tended  high standard living
another thought  taxes actually went somewhere  went supposed  ' see couldn ' pay health care university system
every european met scoffs incredulous universal healthcare pay university
drive home frustration  one gets tangential thinks f*ing war location heinous government spending 've suffered last x many years
big mess  huh !
