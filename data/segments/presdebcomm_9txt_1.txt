one things next president must remind people going responsible period location  us must love children heart soul
happened believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement  though
think measure post results internet town newspapers  parents say wait minute  child 's school isn ' want  therefore  become involved education
recognize ' seem care
lot parents feel like everything going well child 's school  sudden wake realize wait minute  standards aren ' met

'd like start telling vision
see day location location america public schools considered excellent  world class
failing schools  classrooms small enough size  number students  teacher spend enough one-on-one time student
means recruiting new teachers public schools
means plan hiring bonuses get number new teachers public schools within next four years
means also helping local school districts sometimes find parents school age children outvoted bond issues  give help interest-free bonding authority build new schools modernize classrooms
need give teachers training professional development need  including paid time go visit classroom master teacher pick new skills
want give every middle-class family $ number year tax deduction college tuition middle-class families always able send kids college
want work universal free school know studies youngsters learn  kids learn first years life else
said contrast
governor person vouchers  plan proposes drain money  taxpayer money public schools private school vouchers money proposes entire budget public schools
