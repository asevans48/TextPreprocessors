political conventions little practical purpose modern american politics  still symbolic impact
two major political parties spend years millions dollar project images unity  purpose  especially patriotism
main motif event misc flag  color scheme red  white  blue
well  usually except 's magenta  cream  cerulean
earlier  person took pictures pepsi center podium dncc  color scheme looked rather strange  colors design bear small resemblance colors misc flag
sure  call red  white  blue  're pastels color family
's exacly strong representation usual theme
case person 's camera malfunctioned  checked denver post
well
much better
looks even strangely garish official convention site  looks like academy award show loud  ugly  misshapen
speakers get lost overdesign  even without odd color scheme
contrast person literally figuratively republican color scheme presentation  terms symbolic power resonance  gop clearly remained tradition  opting strong  authentic colors
democrats ' pastel offering may symbolize something  's neither tradition strength
update  courtesy comments section  's person person number republican convention  update ii  'm one noticed chaotic nature democratic design
person person new york times advises sunglasses  's almost democrats wanted distract viewers
