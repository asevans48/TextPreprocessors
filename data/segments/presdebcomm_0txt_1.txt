let 's get bottom line
want bring rates

'd think  well  lower rates
romney  reason small business pays individual rate ; number percent location 's workers work businesses taxed corporate tax rate  individual tax rate
lower rate  able hire people

( crosstalk ) lehrer  's started
yeah
challenge governor said plan
obama  well  number months 's running tax plan
five weeks election  's saying big  bold idea  `` never mind  ``
fact lowering rates way described  governor  possible come enough deductions loopholes affect high-income individuals avoid either raising deficit burdening middle class
's - - 's math
's arithmetic
governor person share deep interest encouraging small-business growth
time tax plan already lowered taxes number percent families  also lowered taxes small businesses number times
want continue tax rates - - tax cuts put place small businesses families
said incomes $ number year  go back rates bill person president  created number million new jobs  went deficit surplus  created whole lot millionaires boot
reason important  can not reduce deficit  can not encourage job growth small businesses  're also able make investments necessary education energy
obama  difference  though  comes definitions small business
- - plan  number percent small businesses would see income taxes go
governor person says  well  top number percent  're job creators  'd burdened
governor person 's definition  whole bunch millionaires billionaires small businesses
donald trump small business
know donald trump doesn ' like think small anything  - - 's define small businesses 're getting business income
kind approach  believe  grow economy  way pay without either burdening middle class blowing deficit make drastic cuts things like education  making sure continuing invest basic science research  things helping america grow
think would mistake
lehrer  right
