well  warning signals went unheeded location
thankfully  location
look housing crisis greater detail
'd like outline plans address
numbernumber million foreclosure notices went last year number % number
communities color especially hard hit
subprime loans five times common predominantly african american neighborhoods predominantly white ones
number % loans hispanics subprime compared number % whites
crisis isn ' number million households risk losing homes  course  numbernumber million foreclosure notices means many people obviously homes anywhere two ten people live
's tens millions families lost value homes
talk home foreclosure crisis  sometimes people  tell  look little skeptically  tell  're thinking  didn ' buy one mortgages  ' arm  'm risk
fact  case
home prices dropped almost number % last quarter
home prices everyone
paid home  fixed rate mortgage manageable interest rate  suffered steepest decline record
means families lost least $ numbernumber trillion housing wealth far  nearly two-thirds size entire location location government budget
today  nearly number million families struggling mortgages water
actually owe mortgages homes worth
biggest financial asset financial liability
housing crisis also crisis cities  towns neighborhoods
least number million homes lose value foreclosures neighborhoods  including numbernumber million homes right location
abandoned homes boarded neighborhoods mean higher crime rates  lower property values  plummeting tax receipts cities towns across location
year ago march number called immediate action address abuses subprime market  laid detailed concrete proposals
warned administration problems subprime mortgages would soon spill regular mortgages
response president
well  treasury secretary told congress problem  quote  `` contained  ``
president assured us would  quote  `` soft landing housing market  ``
housing crisis spread subprime traditional mortgages
august last year  warned administration housing mortgage crisis would soon ripple throughout entire economy
called immediate action laid concrete proposals prevent foreclosures help states hard hit crisis
also called tighter regulation housing market  starting unscrupulous mortgage brokers taking advantage families
would require mortgage brokers disclose right front 're paid based size mortgage sell  put buyers notice
would work states develop strong  meaningful broker licensing standards screen brokers govern conduct would require brokers register federal government home buyers background checks ensure 're dealing someone deal fairly
also called greater regulation mortgage lenders
would eliminate prepayment penalties lead high rates default
would require lenders take account borrower 's ability pay property taxes insurance fees deciding whether make loan first place
many loan lenders haven ' made part calculation many families ' know need budget expenses
october  proposed legislation  foreclosure rescue fraud act  imposed new criminal penalties lenders taking advantage people  offering foreclosure rescue schemes lure families  take money nothing help
've also proposed amend bankruptcy code give judges discretion write value struggling families ' homes
believe  bankruptcy judges write value many things help families pay debt  homes
write value write value second homes  seems kind ironic
making amendment code help families bankruptcy pay mortgages stay homes
response administration
well  continued wait ' see approach  largely ignoring mounting problems
december last year mortgage crisis become national credit crisis
went new york city told wall street needed part address crisis
put forward aggressive plan number-day moratorium subprime foreclosures voluntary five-year freeze interest rates subprime mortgages
response administration
plan let banks hook left homeowners fend
words one expert  president 's plan bank lobby 's dream
administration 's top economic priority seems lavish roughly $ number billion tax cut wealthiest number % americans families lost nearly five times value homes
last week became clear wall street brink financial melt  fed administration sprang action
fed extended $ number billion lifeline prevent bear stearns imploding took unprecedented action provide tens billions dollar credit struggling investment banks well
homeowners  hand  received next assistance
well  let 's clear
families losing homes  's also financial crisis
people 's greatest source wealth losing worth  college costs health care costs food gas prices shoot  's financial crisis
`` sale `` signs line streets across country  cities towns struggling costs foreclosed properties  also financial crisis
families feeling anxiety right
hear stories every day  location location  location location location
last month  little girl stood town hall holding asked going `` people children ' food houses  ``
started commend concern less fortunate  interrupted said  `` 'm losing home  ``
mother hair dresser whose customers tightening belts
're coming often  're much done
adjustable rate mortgage could longer afford
've come together today city american ideals `` life  liberty pursuit happiness `` justice equality inscribed founding documents
mean family 's lost nest egg hopes dreams went
mean little girl goes sleep night worried losing home
housing crisis heart american dream crisis
home isn ' greatest asset  greatest source wealth 's greatest source security
's anchors neighborhood community
's center family
past seven years  've president stands special interests insurance companies mortgage companies wall street
's time president stands american families  president rein special interests rebuild misc middle class
past week  've seen unprecedented action maintain confidence credit markets head crisis wall street banks
's time equally aggressive action help families avoid foreclosure keep communities across country spiraling recession
today  announcing four part plan protect american homeowners  plan help families keep homes help communities hard hit housing crisis
plan starts aggressive new effort help millions at-risk families restructure mortgages stay homes
tens millions americans lost value homes  numbernumber million struggling mortgages underwater
number percent homeowners - - highest percentage since great depression
home prices fall another number percent  one third homeowners find boat
time action month  year
reality many families need basic refinancing
's support new legislation proposed colleagues  representative person person senator person person would expand government 's capacity stand behind mortgages reworked affordable terms
currently  families apply government  government decides individual basis whether work restructure mortgages
heard governor say maybe number families helped location
slow process helps relatively families  simply isn ' enough revive housing market
frank-dodd legislation would move beyond incremental approach setting auction system mortgage companies hold hundreds thousands mortgages
system  companies could sell mortgages bulk banks buyers
buyers would willing purchase mortgages restructure make affordable families know government guarantee refinanced
would good families  keep homes
would good mortgage lenders  's profitable foreclosures
would good economy  helping unfreeze credit markets
given severity today 's housing crisis  simply facilitating auction process might enough get economy moving
's believe federal housing administration also stand ready temporary buyer purchase  restructure  resell underwater mortgages
past  kind temporary measure government could give economy boost needs families help certainly need
would require single new federal bureaucracy  would designed self-financing time would cost taxpayers nothing long run
sensible way everyone lenders  investors  mortgage companies borrowers share responsibility  keep families homes  stabilize communities economy
order determine whether approach outlined representative frank senator person sufficient whether need government step purchaser calling president person appoint emergency working group foreclosures
second part plan
simply can not wait congress passes legislation find best way help millions families
's 'm proposing emergency working group foreclosures
could led distinguished  non-partisan group economic leaders like person person  person person  person person
's kind proactive step would help re-establish confidence economy showing president administration taking economic crisis seriously
've calling several weeks president show sense urgency
group 's first order business would determine government implement solutions proposed frank-dodd legislation whether legislation goes far enough
's decided additional steps needed  investigate whether person federal housing administration government entities  person person person person  could buy  restructure resell underwater mortgages
group would report back congress tight timeline three weeks
meantime  emergency working group formed  implement moratorium foreclosures first called december
every unnecessary home foreclosure worsens credit crisis depresses housing prices
secretary person others finally acknowledged need moratorium certain cases
hope act implement quickly possible implement
third part plan new housing stimulus package provide $ number billion directly states localities  like person location  hard hit crisis
right  concentrated clusters foreclosures devastating communities
recent study ten states us conference mayors found foreclosure crisis lead numbernumber billion dollar lost tax revenues ten states alone
month ago  congress passed  president person signed  $ number billion stimulus package
package next nothing help homeowners communities struggling foreclosures
said time  address housing crisis  would able stem bleeding
congress trying combat recession caused housing crisis without anything address crisis
well  fed extend $ number billion help bear stearns address financial crisis  federal government provide least much emergency assistance help families communities address
's 'm calling creation one-time emergency $ number billion fund would go directly cities states address housing crisis
money could used purchase foreclosed distressed properties  cities states could resell low-income families convert affordable rental housing
could used help neighborhoods high foreclosure rates avoid increased crime blight investing everything police fire support graffiti removal better lighting
could also used local agencies provide counseling refinancing help families avoid foreclosure first place
governor person leading way programs like location
location homeowners emergency mortgage assistance program offers small  low-cost loans families facing foreclosure
saved number homes since started
past october  governor person launched two additional programs help homeowners refinance restructure mortgages
're seeing results location  since end number  pennsylvania 's foreclosure rate decreased number percent
look forward working governors like governor person mayors like mayor nutter  already providing outstanding leadership location  replicate kind success across location
fourth final part plan involves passing new legislation clarify legal liability mortgage companies act help borrowers stay homes
right  many mortgage companies reluctant help families restructure mortgages 're afraid sued investment banks  private equity firms others actually mortgage papers
remember  mortgages bundled huge packages sold around world
' go see mortgage broker bank lender work deal longer paper
case even though writing value mortgage often profitable foreclosing mortgage companies mortgages
's proposing legislation congress returns provide mortgage companies protection threat lawsuits
know kind policy isn ' particularly glamorous probably won ' make headlines
make critical difference helping families save homes getting economy back track
may claim plan 've outlined today `` bailout  ``
'll argue 's government 's role help
well  kind tired rhetoric 've hearing years
think american people know better
've enough old ideology
're ready solutions
object government helping middle class families low income families devastated housing crisis  say  've given bear stearns $ number billion lifeline  've given creditors  lenders customers associated lifeline
lending billions dollar day help wall street banks aren ' regulated  held accountable
tell family lose home 's nothing help
tell failed spectacularly would 've helped failing quietly  desperately  turning backs
tell nothing rebuild american dream
