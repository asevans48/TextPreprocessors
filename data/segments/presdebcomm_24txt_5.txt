mr
newman  mr
kondracke  question mr
person
strategic weapons mr
kondracke  mr
person  say respect soviet union want negotiate mutual nuclear freeze  yet would unilaterally give mx missile organization - number bomber talks even begun
announced  advance  reaching agreement organization important thing world
aren ' giving away half store even sit talk
mr
person
matter fact  vast range technology weaponry right provides bargaining chips need
support air launch cruise missile  ground launch cruise missile  pershing missile  trident submarine  d - number submarine  stealth technology  midgetman - - whole range technology
disagree mx 's sitting duck
'll draw attack
puts hair-trigger  dangerous  destabilizing weapon
organization - number similarly opposed  number years location location preparing meet organization - number
secretary defense said would suicide mission built
instead  want build midgetman  mobile thus less vulnerable  contributing stability  weapon give us security contribute incentive arms control
's 'm stealth technology  build stealth bomber - - 've supported years - - penetrate soviet air defense system without hope perceive radar system frustrated
words  president make choices
makes us stronger
final point use money save weapons spend things really need
conventional strength europe strength
need strengthen order assure western allies presence  strong defense  also diminish reduce likelihood commencement war use nuclear weapons
's way  making wise choices  're stronger  enhance chances arms control
every president one able  nation - - world dangerous result
nuclear freeze mr
kondracke  want follow mr
person 's question
seems question verifiability  problems extent freeze
seems  example  testing would difficult verify soviets encode telemetry
research would impossible verify
numbers warheads would impossible verify satellite  except onsite inspection  production weapon would impossible verify
view  going frozen
mr
person  agree arms control agreement  including freeze  's verifiable
let 's take warhead principle
warhead principle - - counting rules years
whenever weapon tested count number warheads  whenever warhead used count number warheads  whether number less
standard rules
agree production restrictions - - agreements  unless ability verify agreements
' trust misc
believe every agreement reach must verifiable  agree anything can not tell every day
words  've got tough
order stop arms madness  've got push ahead tough negotiations verifiable know soviets agreeing living agreement
support us allies mr
kondracke  mr
president  want ask question negotiating friends
severely criticized president carter helping undermine two friendly dictators got trouble people - - shah location president person location
leaders heading trouble  including president person location president person location
prevent location becoming another location
president  person  criticize president undercutting stalwart ally - - shah location
convinced far line people wanted happen
person done bidding carried load middle east quite time  think blot record let
things gotten better
shah  whatever might done  building low-cost housing  taken land away mullahs distributing peasants could landowners - - things kind
turned maniacal fanatic slaughtered thousands thousands people  calling executions
matter somoza - -  never defended somoza
matter fact  previous administration stood - - could done anything position time - - revolution take place
promise revolution democracy  human rights  free labor unions  free press
person done location  sandinistas ousted parties revolution
many contras
exiled  jailed  murdered
installed marxist-leninist misc government
say  many times - - location  also  know things location look good us standpoint right democratic rights  alternative
large communist movement take location
friend since inception nation
think 've enough record letting - - guise revolution - - someone thought little right would  letting person go  winding totalitarianism  pure simple  alternative
think 're better  example location  trying retain friendship help right wrongs see  rather throwing wolves facing communist power pacific
mr
kondracke  mr
president  since location location two strategically important bases location  would overthrow president person constitute threat vital american interests   would
president  well  say  look overthrow would mean government would would follow
every evidence  every indication government would hostile location location
would severe blow abilities pacific
mr
kondracke  would
mr

formal doctrine arcane  'm going ask deal anyway
believe mad  mutual assured destruction  mutual deterrence practiced last generation
mr

would like see elimination
meantime  strong enough make certain soviet union never tempts us
decide generalized objectives reality
president says wants eliminate reduce number nuclear weapons
fact  last number years seen weapons built  wider vigorous arms race human history
says wants system make nuclear wars safe  nobody 's going get hurt
well  maybe someday  somebody dream
start arms race
destabilize relationship
