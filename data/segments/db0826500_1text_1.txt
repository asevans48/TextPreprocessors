enough  however  revel irony hypocrisy administration 's current plans
two things central  one solving financial crisis  way preserves constitutional values oversight  checks balances  accountability rule law
government must power act  powers actually needs  would enjoy foreseeable future
must able make decisions  without accountability oversight
debate  even though nominally concerns passage emergency measure  ultimately debate constitutional proportions
' think overstated little credibility people insist complete discretion anything choose
arrogance even suggesting thing  considering history  breathtaking
person right
president  even one like  powers
's entirely possible  considering scope problems 's facing  next president serve one term  even 's two  would bet wheelbarrow full worthless dollar republican seeks succeed someone wants use powers  badly
lot stake  won ' worth thing ' make sure people charged ``  fixing `` problem understand working insist `` show work `` stand behind
fyi  `` plan ``  currently written  bears striking resemblance aumf
seriously
