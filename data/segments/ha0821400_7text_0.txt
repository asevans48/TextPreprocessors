yeah  waste sort rhetoric
's one thing 've learned week  's white liberals slow perceive racial allusions
nobody  means nobody except chief strategist
never mind
two points
first  aiming reference union 's demography
wouldn ' think mention race front white democrats won ' appreciate point 's simply enough political benefit raising white audience
latter  shows seriously takes great national conversation thinks  consistent fact big race speech months ago would never delivered wright scandal dropped political bomb lap defuse
say  person 's rhetoric subject almost always transparently self-serving  normally wouldn ' begrudge politician  grates presumes lecture seriousness matter
beyond  though  seems distinguishing merely bringing race injecting formally subject debate campaign
quibble distinction might parsed  's hint  broach subject context explicit attack person ( conservatives generally  course )  probably qualifies injecting
simply meant white democrats ( person person excepted ) aren ' attuned racial allusions way minority democrats therefore wouldn ' thought mention
let 's test theory
's clip person june explicitly making racial point fundraiser location
according nyt 's pool report  audience mixed-race
listen applause  obviously appreciate point
watch video days ago  shot audience mostly white democrats location ( number % white ; video union  's harder hear crowd reaction 's shot outdoors )  reasonably  never expect understand
reaction oddly similar
must coincidence
exit question  find troublesome person defended bit eagerly
update  battle  resumed whenever person person decides re-inject race campaign defending person 's accusations 's racist
