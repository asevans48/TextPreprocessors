( republican ) lost weekendby ddayso latest fisa bill  house senate supposed meet today begin compromise restore act  telecom amnesty  senate intelligence committee version bill
republicans took walk refused negotiate  ``
bipartisan  bicameral meeting  staff members house senate judiciary intelligence committees met today work good faith reach compromise fisa reform
said  using week work compromise strengthens national security protects americans ' privacy
unfortunately  understand republican counterparts instructed staffs attend working meeting  therefore allowing progress made bipartisan  bicameral way
disappointed today 's meeting could reflect bipartisan effort  continue work hope republicans join us put nation 's security first  ``
extension protect america act expired last week  outrage us going wind dead  beds  today  fact 'm surprised 's anyone alive still reading  apparently important enough forsake political grandstanding

rather seeing number one-time victory based unique historical circumstances  've come see universal recipe electoral success
minds  win taking national security issue dems divided embrace policy maximizes executive authority ( precisely  bush 's authority 'm sure 'll transform squawking hayeks person person win )
reason gop embraces number completely essentially flipside dems avoid  shall say  deeply satisfied results
winning elections nice
