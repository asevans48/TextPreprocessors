nation 's economy mr
wieghart  mr
president  number promised american people - - campaign - - balanced budget number
've bigger deficits number years 've office
mr
president  secret plan balance budget sometime second term   would lay plan us tonight
president
plan - - secret plan
matter fact  economic recovery program presented took office number
true earlier  working prominent economists  come  campaign  economic program thought could rectify great problems confronting us - - double-digit inflation  high tax rates think hurting economy  stagflation undergoing
even election day  something none economists even predicted happened  economy worsened openly saying thought basis plan could brought balanced budget - -  longer possible
plan following plan based growth economy  recovery without inflation  reducing share government taking gross national product  become drag economy
already  recovery going number months point call expansion
year  seen $ number billion reduction deficit last year  based mainly increased revenues government getting without raising tax rates
tax cut  think  instrumental bringing economic recovery
reduced inflation third
interest rates come number number points  think  must come
last number months  number million people gotten jobs - - created new jobs people number million civilians working  number million ; number  count military
believe continue reduce level government spending - - increase  rate increase government spending  come number number percent   time  growth economy increases revenues government gets  without raising taxes  two lines meet
meet  balanced budget
mr
wieghart  mr
president  congressional budget office bad news
lines aren ' meet  according projections
project budget deficit continue climb
year number project budget deficit $ number billion
view  view economic recovery enjoying  would make sense propose tax increase take fiscal measures reduce deficit  times relatively good
president
deficit result excessive government spending
frankly  take seriously congressional budget office projections  wrong virtually  including fact recovery wasn ' going take place begin
taken place
said  rate increase government spending number percent
rate increase government spending held number percent - - 're far - - number would reduced budget deficits $ number $ number billion level
time  number-percent recovery continue period time  mean - - without increase tax rates - - mean $ number billion government revenues
think lines meet
actually  constant dollar  domestic side budget  spending increase number years
mr
wieghart  mr
person  carter-mondale administration didn ' come close balancing budget number years office either  despite fact president person promise balanced budget term
proposed plan combining tax increases budgetary cuts changes administration government would reduce projected budget deficit two-thirds  approximately $ number billion number
still enormous deficit running number years
steps think taken reduce deficit position country economic growth
mr
person  one key tests leadership whether one sees clearly nature problems confronted nation
perhaps dominant domestic issue times enormous deficits
respect president ; respect presidency  think knows
fact  every estimate administration size deficit billions billions dollar
matter fact  number years  've missed mark nearly $ number billion
told would balanced budget number
$ number billion deficit instead
major question facing american people whether 'll deal deficit get sake healthy recovery
virtually every economic analysis 've heard  including distinguished congressional budget office  respected  think  almost everyone  says even historically high levels economic growth  suffer $ number billion deficit
words  doesn ' converge president suggests
gets larger even growth
means continue devastating problems foreign trade
worst trade year american history far
rural farm friends continued devastation
real interest rates - - real cost interest - - remain  high  many economists predicting 're moving period slow growth economy tapering may recession
get level number percent gross national product policy 's fair
've stood told american people think 's real problem  destroy long-term economic growth  've told think done
think test leadership  think american people know difference
mr
wieghart  mr
person  one way attack deficit reductions spending
president submitted number proposals congress  many instances house  controlled democrats  opposed
isn ' one aspect leadership prominent democrats encourage responsible reductions spending  thereby reduce deficit
mr
person  absolutely  proposed hundred billion dollar cuts federal spending number years  going cut social security medicare student assistance things - - [ applause ] - - people need
people depend upon us little security  'm going way
rate defense spending increase slowed
certainly find coffeepot costs something less $ number
ways squeezing budget without constantly picking senior citizens vulnerable american life

' want hear
want hear arguments whether good bad people - - morally right
basis basis alone  make decision every issue
regard feeling thought record bespoke possible taking us back things knew previous administration  record spoke praise deficits several times  said weren ' abhorred - -  matter fact  one time said wished deficit could doubled  stimulate economy helped reduce unemployment
ms
sawyer  followup  let draw another specific  could - - specific democrats claimed campaign - - essentially based imagery
one specific allege  instance  recently showed opening ceremony buffalo old-age housing project  fact  policy cut federal housing subsidies elderly
yet picture taken
president  policy cut subsidies
believed partnership  example partnership  local government federal government also private sector built particular structure
've trying  involve federal government partnerships
today subsidizing housing number million people  're going continue along line
thought throwing people snow  whether age need
preserved safety net people true need country  pure demagoguery way shut charitable programs many people real need
safety net  're taking care people ever taken care administration country

ms
walters  thank  mr
president
'll turn person person round questions
person
abortion ms
sawyer  'd like turn area think people enjoy discussing  probably tonight positions two candidates clearly different lead different policy consequences - - abortion right life
'm exploring personal views abortion specifically would want applied public policy
first  mr
president
consider abortion murder sin
second  hard would work - - kind priority would give second term legislation make abortion illegal
specifically  would make certain  party platform urges  federal justices appoint prolife
president  believed appointment judges specified party platform respect sanctity human life
would want see judge regard issue human life
regard abortion  feeling - - 's reference without naming remarks mr
person tied injecting religion government
abortion problem religion  's problem constitution
believe unless someone establish unborn child living human  child already protected constitution  guarantees life  liberty  pursuit happiness us
think concentrate  trying - - know weeks weeks testimony senate committee  medical authorities  religious - - clerics - - everyone talking matter prolife
end  one shred evidence introduced unborn child alive
seen premature births grown-up  happy people going around
also  strange dichotomy whole position courts ruling abortion taking human life
location  sometime ago  man beat woman savagely unborn child born dead fractured skull  location state legislature unanimously passed law signed misc governor - - signed law said man abuses pregnant woman causes death unborn child shall charged murder
isn ' strange woman could taken life unborn child  abortion murder  somebody else  's murder
used term `` death unborn child  '
'  feeling abortion  problem determine - - evidence far comes side unborn child living human
ms
sawyer  two-part followup
take 've said platform   ' regard language ' regard appointments  abortion position test kind justices - -
also  abortion made illegal  would want enforced
would policing units would investigate
would want women abortions prosecuted
president  laws regarding always state laws
supreme court handed decision federal government intervened always state policy
laws murder state laws
would think would point enforcement
say  feel problem resolve
one approached matter
happen church belong part dogma
know churches
sin 're taking human life
time  judeo-christian tradition  recognize right taking human life self-defense
therefore  've always believed mother  medically determined life risk goes pregnancy  right take life even unborn child defense
ms
sawyer  mr
person  turn  consider abortion murder sin
bridging president person said  written society doesn ' know whether life - - human life  fact  begin conception  long doubt  unborn child least given benefit doubt protection unborn child
mr
person  one emotional difficult issues could possibly debated
think questions  however  underscore fact probably way government could answer question every individual case private lives american people
constitutional amendment proposed president person would make crime woman abortion raped suffered incest
really view american people  however feel question abortion  government ought reaching livingrooms making choices like
think can not work  won ' work  lead kinds cynical evasions law
afford continue
disadvantaged go back alley used
think questions inherently personal moral  every individual instance different
every american aware seriousness step
things government things can not
example president cites nothing abortion
somebody went woman nearly killed
's always serious crime always serious crime
compare problem woman raped
really want decisions made judges 've picked agree find person guilty
' think  think 's going exactly wrong direction
location  basic moral questions always let people decide personal lives
haven ' felt insecure 've reached club state point view
's good instinct
're religious people earth
one final point  president person  governor location  signed bill perhaps liberal proabortion bill state union
ms
sawyer  get back moment point  question human life begins - - two-part followup
first  point believe human life begins growth fetus
second  said government shouldn ' involved decisions
yet would say government involved  consequence involvement numbernumber million abortions number
feel
mr
person  basic decision supreme court person make judgment life  's way 's done
's personal private  moral judgment
' know answer life begins
's simple  either
've got another life involved
's rape  draw moral judgments
's incest  draw moral judgments
every woman location present judge picked person person clear personal judgment
won ' work
[ applause ] ms
walters  'm sorry  really must talk audience
're invited guests
know 'm wasting time talking  really unfair applaud - - sometimes louder  less loud - - ask  people invited  polite people  refrain
time rebuttal
mr
president
president  yes
well  regard personal choice  isn ' murderer insisting  right kill someone whatever fault think justifies
'm capable  ' think  us  make determination must made regard human life
simply saying believe 's effort directed - - make determination
' think us called upon stand make decision things might come self-defense tradition
would worked  recognize 're talking life
great society  wouldn ' make lot sense  gentle kind society  program made possible incidents come along someone feels must away unborn child  instead make available adoption
million half people standing line waiting adopt children ' way
ms
walters  mr
person
mr
person  agree  's principal sponsor liberal adoption law  children could come term  young mothers educated  found option  alternative
'm
question whether option proposed president pursued
' agree
since 've got number seconds  let say one thing
question agriculture came minute ago
net farm income number percent last number years  every farmer knows
effect economic policies like massive grain embargo  caused farm exports drop number percent
's big failure
opposed grain embargo administration
'm opposed policies well
ms
walters  'm sitting like great schoolteacher  letting get away things - - one  one
may ask future rebuttal stick rebuttal
also  foreign policy next debate
stop dragging ear one
[ laughter ]  admonished  would like say panel  allowed one question one followup
would try  best could  ask two three - - know 's something want - - two three questions part one two three part two
said  fred  's
federal taxation mr
barnes  thank
mr
person  let ask middle-class americans taxes pay
'm talking rich poor - - know views taxes - - families earning number number year
think families overtaxed undertaxed federal government
mr
person  opinion  deal deficit  people $ number year dealt  carefully  ones didn ' get relief first time around
number tax bill  people making $ number year got $ number tax relief number years  people making $ number year  taxes considered  got relief taxes actually went
's proposal protects everybody $ number year less tax increases  treats $ number way beneficial way president proposes sales tax flat tax

well  day  vice president person disclosed tax returns american people
's one wealthiest americans  's vice president
number think paid number percent taxes
number  result tax preferences  paid little number percent  numbernumber percent taxes
meant paid lower percent taxes janitor cleaned office chauffeur drives work
believe need fairness
's 've proposed think fair responsible proposal helps protect people 've already got relief actually got tax increase
mr
barnes  sounds saying think group taxpayers making number number year already overtaxed  yet tax proposal would increase taxes
think aides said earning number number tax rate would go - - tax bill would go hundred dollar  number number  several hundred dollar
wouldn ' stifle incentive work invest  also hurt recovery
mr
person  first thing  everybody number would tax increase
mr
reagan  election  going propose tax increase  compare proposes
secretary treasury said 's studying sales tax value-added tax
're thing
hit middle - moderate-income americans leave wealthy americans largely untouched
$ number go ladder  proposals far beneficial

[ laughter ] ' plan tax - - increase taxes
'm going increase taxes

president  yes  used - - `` last resort ' ' would always
got government lowest level  could say could go lower still perform services people  recovery complete knew getting ultimate amount revenues could get growth  still slight difference two lines  said  yes  would look see taxes adjusted
' foresee things happening  say great confidence 'm going go tax
