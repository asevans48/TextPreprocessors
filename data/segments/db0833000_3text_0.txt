widely understood  given realities investment returns health care economics  time retiree health benefits would likely become less generous
addition  management labor agreed change health benefits workers  active retired  coverage looked like policies people today  complete co-payments deductibles
new uaw agreement also changed salary structure  creating two-tiered wage system
new arrangement  salary scale newly hired workers would lower salary scale existing workers
one debate propriety wisdom steps ; two-tiered wage structures  particular  raise various ethical concerns
one thing certain  radical change promised make detroit far competitive
carried planned  number -- the final year existing contract -- total compensation average uaw worker would actually less total compensation average non-unionized worker transplant factory
