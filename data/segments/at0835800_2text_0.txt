al gore far declined take warnings daylight change crisis highlighted person person  even though evidence least compelling supporting global warming crisis
deniers field day  claiming december numbernd slightly daylight deecember numberst
global warming  minor fluctuations ignored  besides  said change  climate change
remember  crisis  ignore doubters

many decades  steady non-symmetric flow goods location location
flow goods predominantly counter rotation earth  may ever slightly perturbed rotational precession
rotational axis earth prone shifting  simultaneous flow goods south america north america acted exaggerate precession
many astronomers  means experts daylight change global trade effect  stated earth normally undergoes cyclic change daylight period approximately one year
us recall past year  might remember amount daylight indeed increase starting near end last december ; however  global trade effect disturbed natural periodic cycle
observers already noted loss daylight may seem ebbed
indeed  due overall cyclic nature  loss daylight may cease  even reverse short time
may even witness increasing daylight approximately end june  number ; however  loss daylight apparent  may become completely irreversible fail something quickly
situation become critical
individuals living far north already reported complete lack sunlight week

father darkness change theory  possible future nobel laureate person person writes  daylight change bureau statistics ( dcbs ) made great progress understanding phenomenon daylight loss 's consequences
research points little known compound - dioxi carbon - major contributor daylight loss
today dioxi carbon tiny component atmosphere  comprises number hundredths one percent atmosphere
past atmosphere much greater concentrations life giving compound
low concentrations forcing agent dihydrogen monoxide
recently huge areas northern hemisphere 's atmosphere filled gigantic clouds dihydrogen monoxide gas
gas blocks sun direct cause daylight loss lowered temperatures
therefore recommendations government enact immediately  number
ban use fluorescent lights
produce poor quality light extremely inefficient converting electricity heat
halogen xenon bulbs best
number
start cap trade system government issues warm cap citizens encourages trading small safety deficient vehicles larger safer vehicles transport groups number passengers gear
number
start immediate release excess daylight stored strategic daylight savings time reserve location new mexico
hope government take crisis seriously enact recommendations
