study organization keeps referencing flawed
read study asks participant working gun campus ( illegal cases ) also illegal things ( drugs etc  )

well duh !
'm sure aren ' listening guns policy  probably ' care law therefore won ' care breaking others
'm also going make generalization someone cares less law probably likely show violence toward fellow man ( woman )
' think going yes answer question `` illegal gun campus `` quoted `` gun owners ``
' twist facts
