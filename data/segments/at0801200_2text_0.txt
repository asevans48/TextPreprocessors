top number existential risks humanity
( ht  instapundit ) 's good thing someone thinking things frankly  end humanity something care contemplate much
hand  smart people contemplating weirdest  bizarre means human race cease exist
makes fascinating science reading ' vedone years
consider scenarios
number  biological  intelligence agency  matter astute  military  matter powerful dedicated  assure small terrorist group using readily available equipment small apparently innocuous setting can not mount first-order biological attack
rapid advancements technology  rapidly moving worry state-based biological programs smaller terrorist-based biological programs
's possible today synthesize virulent pathogens location  engineer manufacture prions  introduced undetectably time nation 's food supply  would long delay afflict millions terrible often fatal disease
's new world
yes
please keep end world scenarios  thank
number
person alien race able reach us likely considerably advanced us  would well develop communications diplomatic protocol minimize frictions caused first contact situation  friendly  unfriendly neutral
particular  would discourage actions could easily misinterpreted overtly hostile preemptively scrambling let alone launching misc nuclear weapons possible first contact
rule engaging contact alien race anything possible avoid war since quite likely lose
program devoted developing first contact protocol
addition protocol  careful devices told construct via alien messages  devices could unfriendly ai harmful devices
danger suspected  warning must immediately made public knowledge discourage others activating possible alien weapons
finally  efforts purposely provide technological level location potentially hostile aliens
words  ' piss aliens try keep low galactic profile
finally  bizarre fascinating threat ; idea living computer similuation la matrix never  circumstances  shut  starts assumption future civilisations enough computing power programming skills able create call ancestor simulations
would detailed simulations simulators ' predecessors detailed enough simulated minds conscious kinds experiences
think ancestor simulation realistic virtual reality environment  one brains inhabiting world part simulation
simulation argument makes assumption long take develop capacity
futurologists think happen within next number years
even takesnumber million years  makes difference argument
let state conclusion argument
conclusion least one following three propositions must true  number almost civilisations level development become extinct becoming technologically mature
number fraction technologically mature civilisations interested creating ancestor simulations almost zero
number almost certainly living computer simulation
obviously  brilliant people entirely much time hands
like science fiction turned science fact  read whole thing
hand  want fall asleep tonight  perhaps
