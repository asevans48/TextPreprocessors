location post continues rather dishonest meme regarding status forces agreement ( sofa ) location today 's edition
claim agreement withdrawal contradicts years promises refuse leave location based timelines alone
post completely ignores context promises changed conditions location  unadulterated hogwash
person repeatedly vowed withdraw location violence dwindled levels location handle
've already arrived point
misc army national police handling primary security duties months  took back control militia-held areas initiative earlier year
three years length sofa iraqis able seal borders defend assault within without location
signing sofa doesn ' reverse anything
've won war  've finally won peace
're negotiating future relations sovereign democratic ally
post also indulges another misleading point along lines  perhaps person person doesn ' realize  us needs official approval forces remain location starting january number  needed implicitly since location held first constitutional elections
're organization mandate misc government supported several years
iraqis demanded leave period  would left
even inclined ignore sovereign government location  organization would almost certainly withdrawn mandate
entire paragraph completely pointless
person wants extend military presence location  negotiate iraqis  bush would  person person won election
moment  iraqis want us entirely  may change number grows nearer
may want us help provide air cover rebuild air force  provide military assistance location gets menacing
case  always subject negotiation  sofa doesn ' impede future options
post supported war  still seem difficulty understanding
vast difference retreating one 's enemies returning war won
george bush 's point along  article shows still hasn ' learned
