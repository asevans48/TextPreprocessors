often rape get used joke days
often  except one particular context victims men prisons
circumstances  joke gets told  movies  political speeches  late-night television
person person reminds us yesterday 's la times  easy familiarity elicits broad laughter jokes indicts us passive enablers human-rights atrocity shows signs abating ( via instapundit )  hardly current political class seem disturbed phenomenon either party
uncle person person tried raise served location assembly early numbers  apathy doomed attempt
solutions better enforcement  lower prisoner concentration  alternatives non-violent criminals cost much money
can not last word epidemic
people put prison earned way confinement  responsibility protect sexual brutality get
become wards community  widespread rapes happening full knowledge tacit approval makes us complicit abuses
bill lockyer 's comments showed tacit approval  coming highest law-enforcement official location
kind message send rapists prison  're performing part duties state inflicting punishment
need start making tough decisions
either need build lot prison space hire lot prison guards keep current incarceration rates  need start rethinking criminal statutes eye towards eliminating violations result violence anyone else
can not keep laughing prison rapes sort sick joke without working end
