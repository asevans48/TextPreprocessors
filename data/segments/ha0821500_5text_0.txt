starting yesterday  sitemeter caused thousands blogs fail internet explorer number reason
hot air person person sites affected
according person person  problem exists sitemeter 's website
appears sitemeter changed coding yesterday without warning users  without testing going live changes
way  feel little silly posting  people really need read won ' able access  people read won ' problem
affects ienumber ; browsers load page problem
'm hoping message filter readers start using alternate browsers access favorite sites
meantime  working disabling sitemeter code sites restore full operability
use three different browsers different purposes
primarily operate blog firefox  blogging  like separate window news browsing ( like alt-tab writing )  've noticed problems past running two separate windows firefox simultaneously
laptop  've kept ienumber default open links feedreader ; desktop  recently switched safari
'm still getting used safari  believe like little better ienumber quite much firefox
particularly like way displays history  ' like doesn ' allow multiple home pages startup like firefox ienumber
safari crashed doesn ' seem memory hog others running several tabs
even love ienumber  's good idea second browser handy case issues like arise
sitemeter eventually get act together  'll sites back shortly
thanks patience
