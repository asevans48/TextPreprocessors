advice  take reports ocean 's worth salt

msnbc time retracted reports

's yesterday  emanuel 's spokesperson kindly told us   hadn ' taken gig
reported
one cases competition media outlets paradoxically produces worse journalism
's major pain butt folks like want keep readers accurately informed
's true sometimes major players keep flacks dark accepting gig work inside angles
still  ' stick reporting know true
's important  reams mis-information make harder person manage transition
getting transition right kind big deal
