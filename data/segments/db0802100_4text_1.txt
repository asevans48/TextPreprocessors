maybe mr
person  supporters insist  simply praising reagan 's political skills
( think trying curry favor conservative editorial board  fact endorse  )

makes clear person 's remarks quite disingenuous  remarks clear declaration reaganomics failed
fail
good point  example person 's sheer genius saying things way assume agrees us

catch

read  remember  person 's sophisticated rhetorician way obama  'd say great failure person administration
