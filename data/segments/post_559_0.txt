less high paying jobs includes doctors
universal healthcare work unless location gets doctors ( everyone coverage  everyone going go -- especially situation decided  means people may expect doctor treat every cold  every cut  every bruise
abuse system ) location can not get doctors unless aids students becoming doctors ( protects doctors oftentimes ill-advised lawsuits )
