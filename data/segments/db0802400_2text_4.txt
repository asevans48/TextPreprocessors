borger


's arrogant  though  know  think anointed location 're pretty good television look pretty good - - great name recognition 're `` law order  ``  gee  become president
think talked
think said  know  ' work hard
( laughter ) borger  actually get job  get late  let public take look
're different
're going win
didn ' work way
cafferty  bought part work hard
liked part
( laughter ) cafferty  sit trailer 's time close-up  person person ( laughter ) usual village cattiness  themes progressives pushed moment thompson entered race
's lazy  's actor wants play role president  pushed upon people establishment
true across line  person 's insincere flip-flopper  rudy 's homicidal maniac  huckabee 's jesus freak  person wants bomb whole world ( narrative took hold person dropped map stopped pressuring )  etc
're aided really terrible slate candidates
's clear progressives shot narratives media bloodstream
initially  person guy could smell organization organization  person guy shoulders land number
really think movement maturing deserves lot credit
however  media narratives
able make arguments terms policy
's danger `` radical centrist `` coalition
need force accepting ideas  case health care  like safe reimportation drugs location  guaranteed issue insurance companies  public option competing insurers  etc
reasonable  moderate ideas  debate shifts leftward
otherwise  're going get fake reform rewards insurance companies giving forced market  without regulation cost controls actually help people get affordable coverage
line
's important highlight mark warner telegraphing
'll future  's office president arguably less important health maturity progressive movement leverage change
