person person noted curious exchange misc legislature committee hearing regarding subpoenas investigation troopergate
lead investigator  supposed act independent agent probe  testified democrat person french overruled subpoena list struck witness wanted interview  branchflower explained submitted tibbles ' name subpoena  removed french
person could provide explanation french  endorsed person person  would denied subpoena interview man conducted meeting question
democrats republicans pressed branchflower explain omission  french interjected didn ' see political subpoena
clearly  interference demonstrates partisan nature inquiry
would state location subpoena attendees meeting neglect subpoena man called ran meeting
political exist question tibbles  would exist subpoena participants meeting
reason  french doesn ' want committee hear tibbles say meeting
even beyond question  though  french 's interference shows investigation neither independent apolitical
misc caught manipulating subpoenas predetermined outcome case
strongly indicates french doesn ' much case  feels need distort political reasons
