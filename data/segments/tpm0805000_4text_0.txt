day  person person  's charge hillary 's hunt delegates  caused stir political circles suggesting following  person also acknowledged would possible person lose pledged delegates control majority credentials committee  ultimately decides person michigans disputed delegations would dealt
woah
really possible candidate loses pledged del count could still control process decides happens location location 's delegations
long short answer  's borderline impossible - - 's going happen
's gist works
total number members credentials committee
twenty five appointed organization chair howard dean
remainder alloted state  number 's proportional state 's population and/or democratic performance
process convoluted  essence happens campaign gets send number members credentials committee state number 's proportional number delegates state
virtually ensures number credentials committee members seats state roughly proportional popular vote won state
membership proportional vote state  location says organization press secretary person person
's remotely possible  say  hillary  lose overall popular vote  would end credentials committee members  states like location  would virtually impossible statistically members person overall  let alone majority
one side note  's even clear yet scenarios credentials committee considering
voting  credentials committee seated  meet publicly consider whole range options location location - - scenario favored hillary campaign  seating delegations determined votes states
one proposal  instance  's talked delegations split number-number two candidates
's unclear scenarios ultimately considered
end  credentials committee great deal discretion scenarios vote  hence  ultimately happen
end  scenario envisions hillary losing overall pledged del vote majority members credentials committee - - thus determining happens location location - - pretty much impossible
