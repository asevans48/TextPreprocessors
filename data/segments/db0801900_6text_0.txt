trapby ddayhaving covered campaigns full day  completely see political media dysfunctional
're shuffled one event another
watch speeches town hall meetings
're big rooms candidates watching react thousands people
write column editor probably demanding determine momentum
furthermore  start think 're equipped make determination
would say hillary person win today 's caucuses  bigger enthusiastic supporters last night  gave better speech
reality  ' fucking clue  really ' think anyone
watching speech data used `` horse-race `` story
're seeing volunteer action  're seeing many phone banks  're seeing number precinct captains  race like  's 's going win  's little suggest 's even election tomorrow outside occasional channel number news billboard advertising `` live caucus coverage  `` really person person billboard bigger
polls  recent ones shown person lead  turnout fairly impossible predict
location new organization 's turnout enormous side democrats campaigns put resources face time months
ten-day sprint  'm hearing anywhere number number caucus-goers  makes prediction process completely untenable
traditional media gun shy type environment  're going ( although 're polling heck location location  learned great lesson new organization )
furthermore  'm seeing piece state  albeit piece largest population far ; location location may city credibly judge things way
colleagues calitics northern part location volunteering  transferred campaign person person city many volunteers
's least data point
person 's campaign buying banner ads yahoo !
search engines say `` caucus morning numberam  `` meaning know 'm connecting location
's under-the-radar data point
pundit simply following campaign event event  data verbal tics reactions things actually indicative nothing
could person person flipping behavior someone 's winning ; could also 's legitimately pissed opponent 's campaign making claims giving excuse downplay significance win saying 's vegas `` fix  ``
person 's speech definitely lackluster  standards ; crowd appeared listening buying saying  fumbled around middle
person really fired gave speech emotional highs lows packed high school gym overflow crowd separate room (  arrived late ; even overflow room real sense excitement investment speech )
actually ' sort psychological analysis arrive conclusion person knows 's winning person knows 's losing
's data lot people following campaign
pundits typically televised feed
'm absolving blame  're equivalent gauging score football game watching fans parking lot
glean events  fact data  two candidates actually saying  wish reporters would stick
long wind-up complete  let  ( oh  way  let say edwards long gone got town  otherwise 'd include story  )
person person gave somewhat partisan speeches
decried influence special interests  discussed changing foreign policy unilateralism  highlighted `` predatory lending `` mortgage student loan industries  ended many ideas ( student loan forgiveness exchange national service  green energy green jobs  end war fairly vague definitions end would )
person  international media covering location  location location little section  talked tragedy homeless veterans ( sounds awfully like certain mr
edwards )  indexing minimum wage inflation ( ditto )  `` healing racial wounds  `` fair criminal justice system  admonished crowd `` demonize immigrants - country built immigrants  ``
( appreciated )
peppered speech usual jokes stories  like `` fired  ready go `` story lady small town location location  seems get like person person tall tale every time tells ( mean  person 's day seeing fired lady sounds progressively horrible  'd think next time 'll include bad medical news something )
's section point debate gave greatest weakness  candidates gave  weaknesses things like `` care much people `` `` 'm frustrated haven ' changed country ``  ending `` 's happens 're location  ' speak english
speak washington-speak  ``
talked change `` comes bottom  top-down  `` organize challenge special interests resist progress
end  message pretty much ( notes )  need politics based ideology  common sense ; spin  straight talk
