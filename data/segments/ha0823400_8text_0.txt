misc army increasingly taking charge security operations  location location agreed proposal would see combat troops leaving location number  three years  leave major urban centers summer number
location 's national assembly would agree terms  may object lengthier time frame widely discussed  iraqis want see firm end american combat operations  would likely embrace framework  time frames make lot sense  security forces establishing order  two years ago democrats wanted immediate retreat location
surge  even barack obama admits worked  gave person government enough time press political reconciliation hitting hard militias  insurgents  organization
person claimed recently four weeks ago surge didn ' help stabilize location  ridiculous notion face
however  misc army gaining strength wheels democracy working normally messy peaceful fashion  's appropriate start looking long-term strategy drawdown
iraqis want govern  opportunity afforded misc troops misc stamina  point american troops get way
misc government wants long-term presence misc military support  enter partnership along lines relationships location location location
eventually choice  time coming sooner rather later
drawdown take several years  good reason
location little air power moment  could possibly defend borders neighbors necessary
limited capabilities air power even internal security issues must rely american forces assistance
navy even worse shape  although assistance area doesn ' require large footprint within location
're process training intel services ground  take several years
person  efforts  american combat troops needed
time horizons suggested proposal look realistic  bit optimistic  least terms pullback urban areas ten months
long move trigger violence  gradual reduction combat forces next two years following occur fairly naturally troops little
meanwhile  lasting presence logistical training support help strengthen location without stepping sovereignty
victory looks like
affect misc presidential race
perhaps bit favor person person
person person gets bragging rights  legitimately show person 's judgment failed greatest test war
's one thing say shouldn ' invaded location  another entirely declare needed retreat person said repeatedly number forward lose  rather change strategies beat terrorists arrayed us time
however  victory location makes issue far less compelling six months ago
voters focus economy  person 's populism proven attractive  less foreign policy  unless location heats
person smart  'll simply stop talking location altogether
