healthcare free
first  practical idea
costs doctor 's consultation  medical tests  operations  equipments  hospitals  utilities billions dollar
government could go bankrupt
personally think cheap rather freely available
case  people putting responsibilities health doctors medicines  rather taking care personally refraining alcohol  smoking  harmful substances
nothing free !
