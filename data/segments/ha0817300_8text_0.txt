crosstabs run four pages dive
's apples apples comparison  unfortunately  person 's poll last week offshore drilling ; closest fox gets precise question whether start drilling immediately organization organization person number % say yes  including number % democrats person whether drilling gulf location  number % say yes
anwr
number % say 's time  five-point improvement number three-point improvement number  within margin error
odd reason  possibly fallout location  number numbers throughout poll show harder line environmentalism numbers earlier years  rising gas prices notwithstanding
( note especially response question relaxing environmental standards  opinion dives number points number number completely rebounds  )
one notable exception  though
behold  's major nimby problem per question number  public education nuclear safety would go long way
imagine spectacle republican leaders telling constituents  much learn france  data reveals raising taxes gas idea appeals nutroots betters pretty much one else
exit question  safe conclude public opinion moved towards drilling anwr since gallup found number % opposed last month
update  actually  look data  wonder useful questions drilling really
one  almost one  opposes drilling abstract ; question  properly phrased gallup  whether open areas currently off-limits
aside question anwr  fox didn ' ask
although data nuclear plants still encouraging
