's important us get business
's governor person want
moderator  alluded problems
's magic bullet - - secretary person  question - - magic bullets solve problems public education
next best solution
cheney  think public education solution
desire find ways reform educational system  return former glory
'm product public schools  family  wife daughters went public schools
believe much public school system
look standpoint nation  recent exams
example  national assessment educational progress  independent testing service  shows 's progress reading scores last eight years
almost progress math
achievement gap minority non-minority students big ever
've significant increase spending education nationwide  produced almost positive results
's unacceptable location location
look think  disadvantaged communities  number % fourth graders ' read basic level understanding
've graduated number million kids high school last years ' read significant level
permanently sentenced lifetime failure
want change
think know
governor person done texas
want emphasize local control people location  ky decide best kids
want insist high standards
one worst things fail establish high standards  effect say youngster ethnic background income level  ' kind expectations everybody else
want accountability
test every child every year know whether 're making progress respect achieving goals objectives
think 's extraordinarily important
probably single important issue campaign
governor person made clear 's elected number one priority legislative measure submit congress
moderator  senator
person  al gore committed making location 's public schools best world
disagree opponent said
lot progress made recent years
average testing scores lot extraordinary work done tens thousands parents  teachers administrators around location
done
'll allow  want go back last question
leads question
think us agree leaving aside social security medicare surpluses  's $ numbernumber trillion surplus available spend next ten years
said 're fiscally responsible
're taking $ number billion top put reserve fund
rest 'll use middle class tax cuts invest programs like education
's big difference two tickets
opponents going spend $ numbernumber trillion $ numbernumber trillion surplus projected big tax cut al gore talked night effectively
're saving money invest education
can not reform education improve country without spending money
al gore committed $ number billion purpose
recruit number new teachers reduce size classrooms
help local school districts build new buildings children learning crumbling classrooms
're going stop high school
're going go give middle class ability deduct $ number year cost college tuition
tremendous life-saving change help people carry education allow develop kinds skills help succeed hi-tech economy today
person  important issue  person person maybe could extend education moment
moderator  're asking invoke moderator 's discussion
cheney  yes
moderator  granted
person  thank  sir
person  honor  chance respond
moderator  course
secretary two minutes 'll two minutes
person  lets talk question surplus drives lot 're talking  person
look proposal  take half projected surplus set aside social security
$ numbernumber trillion
take roughly fourth urgent priorities medicare reform education  several key programs want support
take roughly one-fourth return form tax cut american taxpayer
think 's extraordinarily important
fundamental difference two approaches
look  frankly  numbers numbers senate budget committee  totaled promises vice president person made course campaign  $ number billion spending surplus already still month go campaign
fact program put together think responsible
suggestion somehow going tax cuts isn ' true
another way look course next ten years 'll collect roughly $ number trillion revenue
want take number % return american taxpayer form tax relief
highest level taxation 've since world war ii
average misc family paying number % federal  state local taxes
think appropriate return american people make choices money ought spent ; whether education  retirement paying bills
choice prerogative
want give opportunity make kinds choices think totally reasonable approach
moderator  senator
lieberman  let start numbers
due respect  senate budget committee estimates person person referred estimates partisan republican staff senate budget committee
're using numbers presented nonpartisan congressional budget office
start agreement surplus social security fund locked used social security
's agreement ends
also agree believe pledge surplus medicare trust fund also locked sign says politicians keep hands
opponents
fact  raid medicare trust fund pay  well  tax cut programs ' afford 've spent much tax cut
let come back remaining $ numbernumber trillion talked
numbers show $ numbernumber trillion goes big tax cut  al gore said night  sends number % top number %
worse  add spending programs opponents committed  plus cost plan privatize social security  calculations 're $ numbernumber trillion debt
means go back road higher interest rates  higher unemployment  kind self-tax increase every american family
interest rates go    cost mortgage payments  car payments  student loans  credit card transactions
've learned anything last eight years  one important things government  federal government  probably important  fiscally responsible
's al gore committed balancing budget every year
fact  paying debt year number  calculation opponent 's economic plan still leaves america $ numbernumber trillion debt
moderator  time
next question goes
gentlemen  numberst century
yet average american working woman great nation earns number cents $ number earned working male
males propose
lieberman  's good important question
obviously time  fortunately  great advances made women achieving kind equality long denied
person  question absolutely right
women - - actually number received number cents every $ number man receives comparable job
al gore issued economic plan 've stated specific goals future
one goals eliminate pay gap men women
's unfair 's unacceptable
first way supporting equal pay act proposed congress gives women right file legal actions employers treating fairly paying equally
secondly  're going everything using governmental support business agencies small business administration help women business owners opportunity invest begin businesses make larger incomes
civil rights human rights laws think come play
bottom line  unfair unacceptable situation
even though  economy risen last eight years  location 's women risen received income  women receiving amount pay job 're man receives  've achieved genuine equality country
al gore committed closing gap achieving equality
many families women significant bread earner bread earner
cause affects women  families children well
moderator  mr
secretary
person  share view ought equal pay equal work regardless someone 's gender
made progress recent years  think ways go
's differential respect women
look opponent 's tax proposal  discriminate stay-at-home moms children take care go work  fact  kids taken care outside home
effect  stay-at-home mom get tax advantage person tax plan contrasted bush proposal
provides tax relief absolutely everybody pays taxes
's important understand things 're trying change address course campaign agenda future  plans future  focus much giving much control individual americans  men women  single married  much control possible lives  especially area taxation
want make certain american people ability keep earn get decide spend
proposal al gore  basically  doesn '
effect lays number separate tax credits
live life way want live life  behave certain way  qualify tax credit point get relief
bottom line  though  number million american taxpayers get advantages person tax proposal  whereas bush plan everybody pays taxes get tax relief
person  might opportunity respond
moderator  respond senator
caution gentlemen consistently won ' cover lot topics
senator responds  ' feel compelled respond senator
person  depends says
person  important difference us
want clarify briefly
first thing tax relief program 've proposed  one many tax credits middle class includes $ number tax credit stay-at-home moms way saying understand performing service society
want tax credit
second  number number million americans benefitting tax cut program absolutely wrong
's estimate done earlier form tax cut program 's plain wrong
secondly  although governor person says tax cut program  large  gives tax cut everybody  newspapers indicated earlier week  joint committee taxation  nonpartisan group congress  says number million americans ' get governor said would tax program
al gore want live within means
going give away one big tax cut certainly number % public doesn ' need
're focusing tax cut middle class areas tell us need
tax credits better expensive child care  tax credits middle class families ' health insurance employers
tax deduction talked earlier
exciting deduction $ number year cost college tuition
$ number tax credit cost - - well  actually family member stays home parent grandparent ill
exciting tax credit program hope 'll chance talk later  person person encourages savings people early life time life federal government match savings number million americans make $ number less $ number year
briefly  young couple making $ number year saves $ number government put another $ number account
time retire  'll guaranteed social security  $ number retirement fund
's - - moderator  time  senator
person  cpa understand said
fact matter plan complex ordinary american never going ever figure even qualify
's classic example wanting program  case tax program   fact  direct people live lives certain ways rather empowering make decisions
big difference us
like tax credits  like tax reform tax cuts
moderator  mr
secretary  question
would support effort house republicans want legislation restrict distribution abortion drug ru-number
cheney  abortion issue tough one  without question  important one
governor person emphasized  clearly pro-life  thats believe
want reduce incidence abortion society
many pro-choice side said thing
even bill person advocated reducing abortion make rare possible
respect question ru-number  believe - - course  's recently approved organization
really question whether safe used women
didn ' address sort question whether abortion society much evaluate particular drug
would like able look ways reach across divide two points view find things together reduce incidence abortion
things promoting adoption alternative
encouraging parental notification
also think banning horrific practice partial birth abortions area could agreement
congress twice passed overwhelming margins  significant number votes parties  ban partial birth abortions
twice 's vetoed bill person al gore
would hope eventually would recognize 's good position
respect ru-number proposal  stage haven ' looked particular particular piece legislation
governor person made clear night anticipate would able go direct organization reverse course particular issue  primarily decision made drug  question whether would support abortion
person  's important question one two tickets dramatically different points view
answer  would support legislation introduced congress override food drug administration decision ru-number
administration  organization worked number years serious problem
made judgment based good women 's health
doctor pescribe care woman using
think 's decision ought let stand made experts
let say generally significant difference issue al gore respect protect woman 's right choose
opponents
know difficult personal  moral  medical issue  exactly ought left law woman  doctor god
one area agree  al gore  believe government ought everything reduce number unwanted pregnancies
therefore  number abortions
incidentally  good news report
number abortions actually america last eight years
fact  last eight years number teenage pregnancies dropped number %
reason good programs al gore continue support  family planning programs encourage abstinence
health woman involved  think government respectful
supported  fact  bill senate would prohibited late-term abortions except cases health life mother involved
support so-called partial birth abortion bill would prohibited form abortion stage pregnancy regardless effect health life woman
's unacceptable
moderator  question  senator
person slobodan person prevails  notwithstanding election results  would support overthrow
lieberman  well  's good news location today  person person know
's unconfirmed
encouraging news state news agency reporting mr
person president-elect
press reports unconfirmed say person actually left location
happy ending terrible story
's end reign terror
confirmed happen  think location location  european allies  ought everything encourage people location exactly 've last days rise end reign terror person  bring back family nations welcomed location location others
know  'm proud night appears person fallen  leadership role location location played effort stop aggression genocide location location
know opponents said thought overreaching
wasn '
matter principle location 's national interest values
fact stopped aggression  stopped genocide  therefore strengthened relationship european allies nato
fact  made location location respected trusted allies feared enemies
think vice president person played critical role  passionate purposive role leading administration  along republican supporters like person person person person  right thing location
hopefully tonight 're seeing final results bold brave effort
moderator  secretary person
person  noted  person  like person  'm pleased see happened location today
hope marks end person
think probably anything else 's victory serbian people
've taken streets support democracy  support vote
respects continuation process began ten years ago across eastern europe arrived location
saw location  saw rumania  saw location  people eastern europe rose made claim freedom
think admire
think respect process managed recently  want everything support mr
person 's departure
certainly  though  would involve committing us troops
think 's noteworthy appears effort underway get misc involved
noted night  example  tuesday night debate location  governor bush suggested exactly ought try get misc involved exercise leverage serbians
's clear press  fact  's exactly
's - - governor person correct assessment recommendation
supported administration location
lobbied actively passage byrd-warner provision would set specific deadline  one felt soon  forcing us troops
's supportive policy 've seen respect location
think deserves lot credit
would go beyond
think opportunity location location test president person location
fact time ought find whether 's committed democracy
whether 's willing support forces freedom democracy diplomatically area eastern europe
's test whether represents old guard location location
one important challenges face nation manage process integrating number million eastern europeans security economic framework europe
moderator  question  mr
secretary
governor bush charge clinton-gore administration presided deterioration overextension location 's armed forces
us military personnel deployed warriors peacekeepers
cheney  preference deploy warriors
may occasion 's appropriate use peacekeeping role  think role ought limited  ought time limit
reason military able fight win wars
maintain sufficient strength would-be adversaries deterred ever launching war first place
think administration  fact  area failed major responsibility
've seen reduction forces far beyond anything justified end cold war
time 've seen rapid expansion commitments around world troops sent hither yon
testimony joint chiefs staff armed services committee pointed lot problems
example general person person air force number % fewer aircraft  's undertaking three times many deployments regular basis previously
're overcommitted underresourced
unfortunate effects
saw letter day young captain stationed location location  graduate west point ' number getting ready get service 's allowed train troops fuel available vehicles allowed fire weapons twice year
's concerned send combat would mean lives lost
legitimate concern  important area
fact us military worse today eight years ago
major responsibility us future  high priority governor person rebuild us military give resources need job ask us give good leadership
moderator  senator  're shaking head disagreement
person
want assure american people american military best-trained  best-equipped  powerful force world
al gore whatever takes keep way
's right  's good military  run essentially midst partisan political debate
fact 've got judge military military leaders say
secretary person person  good republican  gen
person chairman joint chiefs staff  tell american military ready meet threat may face world today
fact  judging results desert storm location  location location  operations still conducted keep person person box location  american military performed brilliantly
administration turned around drop spending began mid - ' number 's right bush-cheney administration early years person administration  thats stopped
passed largest pay increase generation military
interesting fact  spite rhetoric opponent spoken  reality look projected budgets next ten years  al gore actually commit twice much  $ number billion additional funding military governor person
budget allows nothing additional acquisition new weapons systems
's something gen
person person airforce chiefs services happy need new equipment  new systems al gore committed giving
person  person person special interest mine
would like chance elaborate  might
facts dramatically different
'm attacking military  person
enormous regard men women us military
privilege working four years secretary defense
one higher regard
's irresponsible suggest shouldn ' debate  ignore major  major concern
friends relatives serving us military  know 's problem
look data 's available  number % army helicopters combat ready
combat readiness level air force dropped number % number %
significant problems retention
important thing us remember 're democracy 're defended volunteers
everybody tonight wearing uniform  standing guard protect location location volunteered put uniform
' give spare parts need  ' give pilots flying hours need maintain proficiency  ' give kind leadership spells mission let 's know 're putting lives risk  undermine morale
's extraordinarily valuable trust
important responsibility president location location role commander chief  obligation undertakes behalf person fall us decides send young men women war
send without right kind training  send poorly equipped equipment 's old broken  put lives risk
suffer casualties next conflict ' look basic fundamental problems
due respect administration bad track record regard  's available anybody wants look record wants talk men women uniform  wants spend time members joint chiefs  wants look readiness levels - - indicators
final point  issue procurement important 're running buildup investment made reagan years
equipment gets old  replaced
've taken money procurement budget support ventures
investing future us military
person  's important respond
yes  course 's important debate part campaign  ' want either military feel uneasy american people feel insecure
'm saying 'm basing serving senate armed services committee talking exactly people person person mentioned  secretary defense  chiefs staff
've visited fighting forces around world
'm telling ready meet contingency might arise
good news interesting news met recruitment targets services year
fact  areas opponents said overextended  location  soldiers higher rate re-enlistment anywhere else service feel sense purpose  sense mission
fact  administration begun transform american military take away cold war force prepare meet threats new generation tomorrow  weapons mass destruction  ballistic missiles  terrorism  cyber warfare
fact governor bush recommended major policy statement military earlier year skip next generation military equipment ; helicopters  submarines  tactical air fighters  rest
would really cripple readiness
exactly readiness person person talking
al gore committed continuing acquisition program  transforming military
's still fewer people uniform today  person-to-person  person-by-person  unit-by-unit  powerful effective military  world today  history world
al gore whatever necessary keep way
