person person endorsed barack obama today organization 's meet press
endorsement rumored months  powell made secret disaffection republicans since retirement secretary state
gives barack obama much needed support questions foreign policy military affairs period time people may question whether trust man experience either
powell miss window
'm going impugn powell 's motives
served country honorably every task assigned  's earned right participate political process
unlike endorsers like person person  person person  person person  powell never publicly identified conservative activist
's mostly stayed within military foreign-policy realm could easily served secretary state person administration much bush administration
doesn ' represent hypocritical apostasy  doesn ' come much surprise  either
however  ' think impact may summer  two reasons
first  think people expected powell endorse person  us expected democratic convention
powell hasn ' hidden disdain former colleagues well  especially closest aide person person spent time ripping
coming  may impact voters still feel uncomfortable person 's lack experience
otherwise  ' think anyone likely swayed endorsement didn ' already factor thinking
august  person could used fumbled russo-georgian conflict
though  foreign policy dropped second tier voters
're interested economic issues  think person person plumber resonance person person point election
powell  experience economic issues never spoken  simply doesn ' figure concerns
powell 's endorsement still gives person boost certainly gravitas
really change ground election
'm skeptical
person needs hammer economic themes make powell 's endorsement less relevant last two weeks
