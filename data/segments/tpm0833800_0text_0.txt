thought might know 's going location


person campaign  voicing concern recount missing ballots  put urgent press release alleging number ballots missing single precinct - - happens solidly-dem precinct right location - - calling upon city 's elections director keep recount officially open matter resolved
county 's initial election returns showed person lead number votes person  nearly two-to-one-lead single precinct ( ward number  precinct number )
missing ballots recovered  quite possible person could sustain net loss vote count would enough undo campaign 's claim number-vote lead morning
late update  star tribune info - - including key number person stands lose net number votes apparently misplaced ballots recovered
ouch
city looking situation
initial hypothesis votes may double-counted first time  longer appears case
