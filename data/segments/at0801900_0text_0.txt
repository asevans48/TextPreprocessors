person person ' article today supposedly dire consequences nation 's `` trade deficit  `` obviously well-intentioned  misses mark several respects
first  article based common misconception `` trade deficit `` represents `` transfer wealth persons sovereign entities outside location location  ``
correct
consider balance trade goods  represents vast majority us trade deficit
data provided mr
sevakis show number  figure negative $ number billion
means number  americans purchased $ number billion goods foreigners foreigners purchased goods americans
can not said  however  purchases resulted `` transfer wealth `` foreigners
example  american consumer buys wine italian vineyard  exchange wealth  transfer wealth - ie
american exchanges wealth form currency italian vineyard  provides bottles desired wine return
assuming voluntary exchange  value wine american consumer equal ( greater ) value currency gives ; otherwise  would make purchase
say  `` wealth `` receives form wine equal ( greater ) `` wealth `` gives form currency
meaningful sense  therefore  said american consumer made poorer trade  `` transfer wealth `` implies
indeed  actually richer life enhanced enjoyment desired italian wine
exact analysis applies purchase foreign automobiles clothes trinkets whatever
conversely  data provided mr
sevakis show number  balance trade services positive $ number billion
means number  foreigners purchased $ number billion services americans americans purchased services foreigners
assuming voluntary transactions  foreigners made poorer result trades
received `` wealth `` form valuable services  paid exchanging `` wealth `` form currency
trade goods  mutually beneficial exchanges
economic theory underlying mr
sevakis ' analysis correct  voluntary trades ever would take place one party inevitably would `` transferring wealth `` party  thereby made poorer result exchanges
clearly  either national international economy actually operates
( true transfer wealth reflected current account data provided mr
sevakis entry `` unilateral transfers  `` represent sums money sent country  perhaps immigrant relative home country  nothing received return  )
furthermore  implicit mr
sevakis ' argument notion american would better holding amount foreign currency ( trade-in-services scenario ) holding amount foreign goods ( trade-in-goods scenario )
aware theoretical empirical reason necessarily would case
would person better euros bank account mercedes driveway
vice-versa
depends preferences
bottom  mr
sevakis appears subscribe crude mercantilist viewpoint nations get rich hoarding gold ( today 's terms  `` hard currency `` )
gold currency valuable goods services purchase marketplace - today  due advances transportation communications banking  international scope
true measure person 's nation 's wealth
man stranded desert island treasure chest full gold ducats hardly described rich
similarly  average person living location location number much wealthier even rich person living number number number
