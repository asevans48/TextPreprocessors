'm little amused sudden priority holding presidential debate today  rather two senators focus emerging national crisis simply ' rescheduled
earlier week  barack person described credit meltdown worst financial crisis nation seen almost eighty years  demonstrated didn ' even begin understand origins  wrong
're crisis government intervened impose ideas fairness  balance  responsibility one another
congress demanded lenders lower requirements borrowers mandated person person person person buy bad paper resell securities order encourage overzealous risktaking
free-market failure  's government-mandated collapse  thanks congress forced fairness discipline responsible lending
fact person moment still doesn ' understand shows would repeat mistakes led collapse  would redouble efforts mandate person  balance  responsibility one another person lead us trap
even beyond  person 's correct noting scope failure necessity addressing
given  senators representatives capitol hill  dealing profound crisis since depression
instead  person get dragged back location wants leave hold debate foreign policy
( guess beats working gym  )
putting aside partisan considerations moment  highest priority elected representatives moment
dealing unfolding national crisis congress address  flying town debate could easily get rescheduled little value anyway
order select latter  one produce even one single tangible public benefit results holding debate particular day outweighs need address biggest financial crisis decades
's $ number billion taxpayer dollar risk  opposed debate foreign policy two candidates talking subject length last two years
benefit holding debate tonight outweighs need oversee kind risk
ruben navarette similar thoughts  debates nothing political stunts
pit two candidates discuss complicated issues  give number seconds discuss
debates exist produce sound bites  public policy
're game show aimed people ' pay attention policy make minds determining delivers best comeback
presidential race featured two governors rather two senators  debate could go
governors would role developing public policy address crisis
location  senators already job location  actual policy take priority television show  especially since still five weeks reschedule
barack obama person person already jobs  crisis  's focus
