according friend  location meet organization emission standards gasoline also new cars road
air far dirtier american city 'd including ( sorry  blogging colleagues ) location location
air quality actually pretty good
bad ' recall legalized gambling eight years ago ( someone please correct )   least  rkioskis - kind like number/numbers - electronic slots lottery betting parlors
machines quite busy 've stopped phone cards magazines
's depressing
've written many times  state-sponsored gambling unfair tax innumerate uneducated
's sad see
update  stand corrected
according hirvox comments  gambling lottery parlors around decades
's still depressing  even money used good purposes
ugly use english grown exponentially ( pardon grammar )
english signage  many places  overwhelmed finnish swedish
cafes  restaurants  hotels ' even bother displaying signs anything english
suspect something location popular tourist destination  well certain trendiness among newly rich ( number luxury foreign clothes shops location seems least tripled )
's real pity finnish  non-speaker like  deeply rich strange language  oddly beautiful hear nearly unique
part finno-ugric language family  related misc  really class ( misc one 've heard personally 's close )
great pleasure encountering delicious word like mustikkapiirakka - pretty simple brief word finnish - trying figure could possibly ( go ahead  look )
sadly  translations ubiquitous
even striking  've heard several younger finns speak english near-perfect northeast american accents
words  least schools  're teaching american english  misc english  days
update  silly  never watches tv help
linguistics major informed perfect american accent due misc television series
oh  far  every finn 've met ' possibly understand american election close
' finnish think
