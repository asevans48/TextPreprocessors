however  today person upheld boeing 's challenge award new refueling tanker northrop  could press air force put project back bid  decision vindicates boeing supporters congress  demanded investigation contract went partnership northrop eu-based organization
followed tortured history back-dealing corruption part boeing helped create opportunity northrop
one really came hero instance  provide excellent look sewer defense appropriations  especially big consolidation among contractors field
air force cancels award rebids  decision multitude ripples economic diplomatic circles
us wants compete defense contracts eu countries  award eads ( produces airbus ) showed would open markets well
switch boeing make europeans believe misc politicians never allow significant openness market almost certainly push organization adopt protectionist measures well
air force doesn ' cancel contract northrop/eads snubs boeing  congress inevitably haul procurement officials hearings explain decision
seems lost aircraft best meets needs air force
maybe another round bidding focus trivial issue nationalism  influence-peddling  political intervention
procurement decision different
