person person publicly called closing location location detention center unlawful combatants  objected strenuously today supreme court decision grants terrorists access civil court system
townhall meeting new jersey morning  person called decision one worst us history  says undermine national security  person wanted close gitmo process would terrorists detained us military centers subject military tribunals
boumediene decision accomplished first objective default ; entire argument gitmo didn ' involve sovereign us territory  via eisentrager  civil courts would jurisdiction cases
turning precedent head  court found american sovereignty therefore jurisdiction court misc travels pretty much anywhere misc military forces operate  makes gitmo expensive extension location keys
thought person would cheer decision  shows person envisioned much different process demanded end gitmo
thought congress executive authority structure military tribunals would give detainees due process still treat unlawful combatants rather pows misc residents
supreme court decided makes rules  even though boumediene utterly lacks guiding principles differentiate enemies us engaging war using terrorism average drive-by shooter
person 's longtime friend political ally  person person  proposed amending constitution make clear supreme court ' role conducting war
hopefully  person consider making one causes campaign trail
