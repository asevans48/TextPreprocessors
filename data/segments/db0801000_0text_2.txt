doesn ' mean women identified hillary person also motivated racial considerations
's hot accusation democratic primary suggest women voted hillary didn ' matter affinity rather couldn ' vote african american earlier lied pollsters
( 's person effect  )
's possible 's true  's provocative accusation specific group voters democratic coalition
course  depend person take discussion way swamp  buchanan  would agree racial considerations entered equation make person person beloved heroic  's savior  nonsense
race nothing
dyson
person person overcome despite racial realities
person person walk room proving highly intelligent  highly literate  capable transcending tribal loyalties articulate transcendent vision speaks entire universe political reality
dyson said person wasn ' running `` race man `` person agreed  backhandedly complimenting person getting involved `` jena nonsense `` whole thing devolved ugly crosstalk `` noblesse oblige `` competition `` race gender  ``
matthews eventually tried pin dyson admit hillary 's crying jag brought bunch addled old golden girls vote pin person also racists couldn ' wait pull lever uppity african american
's called `` fair balanced `` show like
takeaway `` insight `` hardball democratic race battle racist old bitches sexist african americans
fabulous
( white men like person  'll notice  ones voting purely merits little scenario  )
dyson  way  gave critique would hope person campaign think twice  dyson  'm suggesting even though tears  sentiment expressed tiredness  verklempt moment talked  also articulation idea find troublesome
suggest `` person
'm gon na get right  's gon na get wrong  `` 's implicit racial subtext  `` ' let black man run country  ``
'm black maybe ' hear racist argument 's spoken  'll grant
candidates pretty close policy run something
person suggesting 's racist opponents say make good president  opponents literally argument make candidacy isn ' racist
case  's hard see anyone could run ' criticize opponent judgment  experience  positions policies suggest 're going get wrong 'll get right
certainly racist person person person person make big deal person 's teenage drug use new hampshire person person talk reason vote
' believe anybody thinks otherwise
dyson 's argument racist sub-text getting wrong getting right doesn ' seem persuasive
'll interested hear people think
person person  smart guy appears 's setting location location primary  large african misc constituency argument person ( people vote ) racist tendencies
person person person  made asimilar comments yesterday  's likely conscious campaign strategy
perhaps work
making big deal person effect end weakening person overall view
person person shockingly wasn ' far assessment  people begin actually believe person ' win even democratic primary  hidden racism  could become self-fulfilling prophesy
' see person 's spokesmen would want get meme started
people fence could easily get idea 's worth voting racists lying pollsters ' win
certainly ' want people believing 's hope african american win
would profoundly depressing - - - 'm convinced 's true
whole host reasons sure won ' help democrats fall give people reason believe racism still deciding factor american politics
suppose 'll see future contests phenomenon presents
face music
see absolutely reason democrats potentially making reality based upon one small sample voters
little display person dyson shows  potentially ugly road walk really hope none campaigns wander far
matthews certainly pimping every day  friends already shown colors gender 're going flogging `` hidden racist democrats `` issue day day
' see democrat would want help
update  hillary effect may another explanation happened
count number reasons hillary beat person new hampshire three points  fascinating  none provable
think everyone 's overthinking tad  including
's one primary
update ii  oh fergawdsake
like clockwork  comes stupid clinton surrogate  person person  mouthing racially charged nonsense
ugh
guess 're going
great
wonderful
