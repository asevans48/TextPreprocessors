yesterday expressed skepticism two reports khqa put person person person person meeting discuss senate successor day winning presidential election  november numberth
searched major chicago newspapers find substantiation  could find mention meeting
reporting came sun-times  reported person said november numberth met person  point time person reason lie
khqa followed numberth another report apparently confirming first
late last night  khqa retracted reports removed website ( via political machine )  khqa 's management doesn ' quite get around apologizing sloppy reporting
first place  reported twice  hardly suggested meeting
's wrote november numberth  sound like suggestion meeting
less explicit numberth  reported meeting taken place using source  story retraction doesn ' bother mention  khqa blew reporting
real information meeting ; made whole cloth  explicitly reported twice corroboration
normal circumstances  one would ever thought double-check brief reports  person 's arrest corruption made khqa 's reports famous
're embarrassed  're trying worm claiming misunderstood
instead insulting readers claiming jumped conclusions khqa reporters explicitly provided articles  khqa management apologize bad reporting
event  person person 's assertion november numberrd person person discussed senate succession  independent reporting found thus far puts two phone together room strategizing person 's replacement
wouldn ' surprised find meeting took place would make sense  politically  person consult obama potential candidates even person wasn ' corrupt people look harder evidence
update  tommy person aol 's political machine tried calling location get better explanation retraction
sure read post see response
