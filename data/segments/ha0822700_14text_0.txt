kidding wondered whether reinstitution fairness would qualify force majeure person 's new contract
belated note clear channel 's lawyers  might want look
last year 's person poll came yesterday 's post  coincidentally enough
breakdown july number  number/number  number % undecided
explains shift
either 's part parcel trend generally towards democrats  person  's fueled conservative reaction election coverage
person didn ' make party crosstabs public last year ideological breakdown number/number favor among liberals number/number among conservatives
republicans fairly evenly divided  conservative numbers almost certainly shifted favor fairness  less odd think note person 's question phrased  government require radio television stations offer equal amounts conservative liberal political commentary
're righty hasn ' given much thought issue  law would correct pro-obama bias media might sound like fine idea
good news
support extending fairness internet dropped considerably  number/number number/number
even dems oppose double-digit margin
populist proletarian medium  guess  less inclined public meddle
