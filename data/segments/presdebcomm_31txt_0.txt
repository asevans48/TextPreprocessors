levy question vice president person
mr
levy ; mr
vice president  labor department today added five major industrial centers list areas substantial unemployment

hand found bill got legislative difficulties consequently action taken
point one  highest priority must get bill depressed areas next congress
made recommendations discussed previously spell campaign
second  consider problem unemployment  realize
analyzing figures find unemployment exists among older citizens ; exists also among inadequately trained ;  adequate opportunity education
also exists among minority groups
're going combat unemployment   better job areas
's program education  program case equal job opportunities  one would also deal older citizens
finally  regard whole problem combating recession  call  must use full resources government respects  one  must see credit expanded go recessionary period - understand  believe 're going recession
believe economy sound 're going move
second  addition  get recessionary period move part economy represented private sector  mean stimulate part economy create jobs - private sector economy
