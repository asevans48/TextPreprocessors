repeated something told
's lie untruth fundamentally misleading way
importantly  proof story isn ' true except hospital ( hardly dispassionate observer ) says  yet person nbvgmh declare absolutely isn '
kornbluth least says `` live question `` whether second hospital  something
evidently  family isn ' talking press  's easy way verify facts
kornbluth claims `` upset story used campaign trail `` doesn ' say knows
anyway  person never used woman 's name - - - press  wrote story
family reason upset person - - - 's even true  doubt
person knows  would talking someone knows facts case 's clear doesn '
press assumes hospital steps forward disputes accuracy story names mentioned hospital must telling truth
reporters wouldn ' wonder would motivate hospital put  hadn ' accused publicly anything  evidently least bit interesting
lack facts backing accusation person lying bad enough  justifications flogging stunning
kornbluth person admit front  without even slightest bit self-awareness journalists  `` perception `` reality
blithely admits al gore person person brought low similar `` perceptions `` exactly way
even slightest acknowledgment `` perceptions `` often created political opponents candidates faithfully disseminated little minions press person admits `` storylines  ``
case  ' know story came  considering 's hospital coming forward truly inexplicable reasons say wasn ' guilty something one accused  suspect republicans
could simply press pulled storyline shelf response location flap ran
whatever case  's bad journalism  thick innuendo short facts used example character defect democrat  creating self-perpetuating `` perception `` justifies `` storyline  ``
old shit
last time saw something like pulled republican  especially one named person person  flip-flopped badly biggest issues day take seasick pills lies easily breathes
never
see  `` storyline `` republicans `` stand-up guys `` `` straight-talkers `` hysterical liars mincing flip-floppers
( surely see symbolism `` stand `` `` flip-flop `` allusions  )
may hate person everything  's fine
kind journalism 's killing political system gets people like person person george person person elected
person repeating story bad health care heard campaign trail american citizen
wasn ' tooting horn putting opponent telling
illustrating plight uninsured country  even turns specifically correct details  certainly something doesn ' happen every day somebody country
fact  suspect particular `` gotcha `` done degrade argument universal health care much embarrass senator person
clinton rules state part story proven true  entire story true
corollary part story republican proved false entire story false
concept work health care
detail bad health care us shown false  notions health care system screwed also false
get ready
' know work  get media play like  subliminal subtext going democrats lying health care
' convince everybody
meanwhile  wrote past week-end  person person sniffle twice entire media crawl 's backs `` correct record  ``
( way  isn ' usual suspects like kornbluth
's `` liberals `` like frank rich  somerby points today  )
trust em
shouldn '
today may using methods rip candidate despise apart  giving much joy satisfaction
may even tell  learned lesson finally seeing things clearly
aren '
kornbluth person openly admitted today democratic nominees gore person skewered perception `` storylines `` basically agreed doesn ' matter 're true
think 's coincidence seems happen democrats bunch condos location location sell number prices
* story painfully reminiscent kind journalistic atrocity perpetrated al gore number - - - like one  mother-in law 's arthritis medicine
bush used one ad - - - total crap
lot 's nice liberals blamed gore losing race  even though came ahead popular vote third party candidate running left
( won ' even bring location ) said  `` run better campaign  ``
well  ain ' easy sophomoric press corps decided ' want president aren ' much fun guy
perhaps time decide like person person better person person
sure hope
'll forgive feel might stand us good stead long run
people agenda isn ' 's best american people
shouldn ' picking presidents even might inadvertently pick one like
nobody elected anything
update  person person declared `` health care story `` person 's death knell  even worse bosnia
person person sitting panel said nothing
update ii  fact check  finally
's worded oddly  typical story  better nothing
clinton erred telling audiences location woman lacked insurance seeking help troubled pregnancy
according casto 's account  bachtel 's medical tragedy began circumstances close essence person 's now-abandoned account  lack insurance created $ number barrier needed medical attention close home
' worry
person won ' telling story trail anymore
maybe 're lucky get democratic candidates stop talking health care human terms fear `` inaccurate `` becoming subject one ridiculous feeding frenzies
wonder democrats keep press far distance possible
meanwhile  person person swilling brewskis back bus person person fanboys  spinning yarns strippers used screw  calling wife cunt  revealing dumber bush policy regaling tales 's gon na `` get shia sunni room tell stop bullshit `` - - - won ' breath word
see  might straight shootin ' stand guy tell public really says
update iii  person gets story family member puts blog
's called  `` person told true tale woe  says kin  ``
'll looking forward corrections clarifications papers msnbc tomorrow
kornbluth teased story appeared person person earlier today let organization go ruined person 's credibility bosnia thing
course  's probably true  press gleefully flogged story person lying without facts
