yes  unfortunately democracy
constitution gives us certain basic rights
want pass laws make majority vote elected representatives
rights violate constitutional ones  courts overturn
happens people amend constitution pass law anyway
constitution didn ' give anyone right marry
people passed laws allowing marriage man woman
laws apply equally  equal protection isn ' violated ( 'm sorry  much right marry member opposite sex anyone else )
' like  vote change laws
's democracy
's perfect  's best thing !
oh  's civil rights  black would horribly offended comparison
fighting basic human rights denied
killed  denied work opportunities right vote
homosexual 's aren ' denied anything ( isn ' already denied everyone else country )
aren ' getting want
