(  )
lived world  would understanding bush pardons people guaranteed personally prosecuted crimes pardons
chief executive little problem proving ultimately responsible anything
course  planet earth far likelier see bipartisan village consensus let bygones person allow people continue lucrative careers set table next time slither way back power
( remember  time  ante  )
wouldn ' seemly see people time crimes
`` decent `` `` good `` excellent dinner companions
considering realities village life  could  starting  make pardoning people come cost great even bush
honestly ' know shame believe think vindicated history
without new administration congress pledging get bottom crimes  ' know 's done
pardons  would appear going get away
