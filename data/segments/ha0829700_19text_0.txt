misc government taken new step asserting lawless tribal regions border location
armed anti-taliban tribal fighters  known lashkars  ak-numbers given free rein conduct operations islamist radicals
person government location wants emulate awakening movement location building grassroots effort terrorism  undoubtedly  help federally-administered tribal areas ( fatas ) like waziristans nwfp
lashkars already almost number men ready fight  organization already taken notice
begun conduct suicide operations lashkars beheaded eight last weeks
lashkars used old weapons little firepower  ak-numbers help close firepower gap organization organization
significant differences location location issue  though
central government almost presence fatas  tribal mix complicated
location  destruction came outsiders brought sunni areas aq  whereas location  combatants natives
awakening look less like grassroots police action civil war  perhaps accurately  tribal war pitting pashtuns everyone else region
location needs assert sovereignty fatas hopes end fighting  militarily
people fatas grave concerns food infrastructure security  tends create radicals
unfortunately  location  becomes vicious-cycle problem  one can not build food security infrastructure radicals target everything sight  lack food security creates radicals
location  broke cycle putting dominant military presence ground
location eventually thing  someone else
given mountainous terrain isolation tribes regions  's going difficult proposition
perhaps lashkars get lucky take location leadership reaching government troops can not
similar strategy worked us number northern alliance
