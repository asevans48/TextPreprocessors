find argument inadequate  circumstantial irrelevant  comparing overall homicide rates `` gun related `` deaths
chicago number list 's sorted alphabetically


/btw  location 's figures rival chicago according list
course lowest gun related deaths states guns banned  duh
lowest bun nonexistent
dc 's highest gun deaths per capita coincidences fact guns legal  doesn ' mean anywhere guns legal crime rates high
plus dc area fewer population ' per capita ' figure naturally tend higher
still nothing counter mburkenumber 's argument
