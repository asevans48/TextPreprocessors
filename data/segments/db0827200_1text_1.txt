argument bailout going us long time come unless democrats play right  going wind holding bag
`` populist republican `` meme alredy starting take hold

would democrats let
right 'm watching person reid  person person stand taking `` credit `` bill
handing plaudits others `` helped `` get done like members `` hills `` mtv awards

update  `` nobody wants support bill  `` said rep
john a boehner  person  minority leader

's quite endorsement
person  wonder many republicans aren ' going able support extremely unpopular bill consciences won ' let
' blame
men women principle  know  put taxpayers first
gosh  sure hope person person persuade st john location abandon crusade great malefactors wealth back extremely unpopular plan might end voting using weapon presidential campaign
( campaign manager suggests 's actually responsible knocking heads together get deal  maybe  )
'm actually less concerned days
