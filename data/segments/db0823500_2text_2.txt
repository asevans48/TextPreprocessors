's new best friend 's argument inside tent
outside  bush administration drafted set regulations could seriously undermine ability american women get birth control
draft regulations put politics women 's health care needs
currently written  bush regulations extend federal law  allowing health care institutions like insurance companies  pharmacies  hospitals refuse provide contraceptive services information
recent years  states across country passed laws protect women 's access birth control
bush regulations specifically seek undermine important protections  including laws  * require employers provide contraceptive coverage equal basis prescriptions insurance plans  * require pharmacies fill prescriptions birth control  * require emergency rooms offer rape survivors emergency contraception ( draft rule  hospitals could exempted even tell rape survivors contraception exists )  * permit state local governments refuse allow hospitals merge result would elimination reproductive health services
addition  draft rule could require government-funded health centers hire employees refuse job
example  implemented  regulations could force family-planning center hire receptionist refuses make appointments women seeking birth control
rule could also make easier organizations refuse provide women contraceptive services information get government money designed support reproductive health care centers
pharmacists ' believe birth control suddenly urgent business federal government
person person say
even so-called republican moderates like person person 's opponent person person location think good public policy  clearly fringe position
's nonsense coming
( oh right
