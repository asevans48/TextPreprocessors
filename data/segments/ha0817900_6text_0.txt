thinly sourced  good enough post
yes  needless say  person isn ' going offer campaign promise ; wants make republican base go sleep election  wake
let offer radical suggestion  would terrible nominate
remember  salient question isn ' whether 'd terrible court
course would  're guaranteed terrible justice obama 's elected
question  would terrible  say  person person person person person person ( two justices likely retire ) even person person
'm convinced  great virtue putting court would remove politics  something person right could rejoice
person person noted last month comes lot legal baggage potential nominee  democrats enough senate majority shrug
exactly great argument majesty put court
maybe  freed political pressures blessed life tenure  'll finally free indulge socialist tendencies instead tossing pragmatist chum periodically threat location much enjoyed going hunting girl
's worry  go back main question
makes hillary threat thousand left-wing judges academics  like say person person  'd hardline warren/brennan liberals court
person person going fall sway 's political celebrity
anything  'd think current justices would want put place junior justice following lead
take risk  reward ' worry president hillary number
plus  bruising confirmation fight 're bound lose person would glorious way catalyzing base dispiriting election
tell 'm wrong
update  afterthought
believe hillary 's guiding star accumulation politicial power  wouldn ' tack left installed court 'd tack right  take advatange fact oldest five conservative justices merely number quite likely outlast even two terms person
want write majority opinions craft american constitutional law  two options  either persuade person person join side ( admittedly difficult ) join majority exchange allowed write opinion cases great import
imagine good machiavellian like hillary making latter bargain
