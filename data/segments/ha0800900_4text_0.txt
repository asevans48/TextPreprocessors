disappointing second place finish new hampshire
guess rumors person 's death greatly exaggerated
think makes today 's biggest cash generator
's campaign 's official announcement haul
major scratch
guy keeps coming second
darth vader might say  impressive
's thing
've discussing status candidacies friends email along surveying landscape new organization
mitt far two second place finishes contested states first location  amounts uncontested since candidate organization
paper  person impressive candidate go resume
one else either side match experience outside inside government  experience isn ' everything
person wouldn ' even hunt anymore
ideas aren ' everything either  fred 's campaign would pulse
thompson put serious plan cut government spending today  campaign lacks buzz  plan didn ' generate much coverage
fred 's impressive idea guy someone cut media size think 'd make good commander chief
well  think
hasn ' run best campaign  's sure
neither huckabee  seems like nice guy tends wing wise  neither person person one guys win eventually
way see things right  three viable candidates two secondary candidates
former include person  huckabee person less order even though person leads delegate count
secondary candidates right person thompson  order
're facing various death scenarios ; person doesn ' play well base doesn ' lot cash  person seems getting locked niche candidacy person needs pick real win somewhere may end life support matter much money
danger becoming locked second place  becomes de facto second choice guy
's way get general election  second place leaves luck
three could win things break right way  couple drop 's impossible see even fred sneaking winning
staying  're sucking various parts conservative base leaving opening person well enough big states super terrific tuesday win
'm saying  thing still wide open
person picking huge chunk cash today  's showing supporters aren ' dispirited 's done yet
update  point comparison probably worth tossing
wired hillary person pulling little $ numbernumber million since nh primary  's without pitch
person camp pulled haul national call day
pulled hillary  hillary wasn ' making special effort
's
money game  donors sides tapped  democrats still seem advantage pool donors remains larger republicans
