number pledged delegates state contests
total popular vote
total number states won
uncommitted delegates primary states
caucus states  's popular vote consult delegates selected decidedly nondemocratic fashion begin
independent crossover voters
personally  'd soon didn ' say selecting nominee party  rules say otherwise
'm superdelegate  count votes  pore exit polls try tease democratic party voters voted
take account obviously disproportionate influence location new organization  two tiny states far power truly democratic process would ever give
'm excited idea superdelegates deciding nomination either  way happen primaries end nearly tied first place
factor number ways primary/caucus process nondemocratic get go  hardly seems practical insist superdelegates somehow divine single `` democratic `` result close race
fact pledge delegates heavily weighted depending past loyalty party represent rural districts ( location )  results delegates awarded number votes cases
want super-delegates count less
caucuses tend favor certain demographics primaries others
location location whole bunch actual humans pull lever whose votes  rules  won ' counted
superdelegates whose presence designed prevent another number-like debacle  may actually trigger one
's mess
problem argument
insisting decision based upon people
system weird ' think anyone tell really party remains polarized
certainly sympathetic notion elite fat cats shouldn ' decide us  think somebody needs set forth detailed criteria go determining democratic way decide thing tie
certainly candidates hedging bets  perfectly understandable
shaping trench warfare
personally  ' think 'll tie much longer
's hard see either candidate unify country ' demonstrate unify democratic party
something break suspect voters ones
