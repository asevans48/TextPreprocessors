funny  going say exactly thing trib - makes rest editorial ironic  founders limited final number words  amendment would unambiguous declaration right possess firearms
didn '  isn '
amendment intended protect authority states organize militias
inartful wording left amendment open public debate number years
last major decision gun rights  number  us supreme court unanimously found correct interpretation
tuesday  five members court edited numbernd amendment
essence  said  scratch preamble  number words count
curtailed power legislatures city councils protect citizens
default position anti-gun crowd allowing law abiding citizens opportunity defend place greater danger
illogic - face - position astounding
gun control crowd readily admits handgun bans like struck location soon history chicago  slightest  prevent criminals getting guns
handgun bans keep hands law abiding citizens wish use weapon self defense - criminals get guns regardless stupid law passed idiot politicians
short  logic saying citizens able possess handguns legally danger criminals could always get handguns regardless law books
madness !
matter
's pretzel logic trib  argue effectiveness municipal handgun bans location chicago
best  limited impact
people ' go far beyond city borders buy weapon 's prohibited within city
neither laws overly restrictive
citizens right protect homes weapons  shotguns
view court decision affirmation individual rights
damage ruling takes significant public policy issue hands citizens
people location longer authority decide  matter public safety  prohibit handgun possession within borders
oh really
fact
let 's follow numbers
number
handgun bans ' work
criminals easily still get guns
number
handgun bans fine anyway citizens use `` shotgun `` `` protect - even though would hard time fitting shotgun nightstand ( children house ) mention spraying house buckshot ever forced using thus endangering loved one
number
public policy decisions taken `` hands citizens `` ( mean `` anti-gun citizen groups `` )
matter `` public safety  `` placed `` hands citizens `` wouldn ' allowing purchase handguns fill bill nicely
trib counted one major newspapers country occasionally endorse republicans office stellar record reporting corruption city government  digging deep ferret dirty aldermen  judges  policemen  others
editorial plain silly
mention fact politician would propose insanity repealing second amendment better one way ticket back home chances sent back location would slim none
