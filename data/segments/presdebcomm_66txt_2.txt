novins  - reduction federal debt
mr
kennedy  - reducing interest rate
judgment  hard money  tight money policy  fiscal policy administration contributed slow-down economy  helped bring recession fifty-four ; made recession fifty-eight rather intense  slowed  somewhat  economic activity number
talked  however  kind programs 've talked  judgment  uh - fiscally sound
medical care aged  would put social security
vice president disagree
program - javits-nixon nixon-javits program - would cost  fully used uh - six hundred million dollar government per year  six hundred million dollar state
program advocated  failed five votes location location senate  would put medical care aged social security  would paid social security system social security tax
secondly  support federal aid education federal aid teachers ' salaries
think 's good investment
think 're going
think heap burden property tax  already strained many communities  provide  make sh - insure  opinion  many children adequately educated  many teachers adequately compensated
greater return economy society educational system second none
question development natural resources  would pay go sense would balanced power revenues would bring back sufficient money finance projects  way location location
believe balanced budget
conditions would unbalance budget would grave national emergency serious recession
otherwise  steady rate economic growth - mr
nixon mr
rockefeller  meeting  said five per cent economic growth would bring number ten billion dollar extra tax revenues
whatever brought  think finance essential programs within balanced budget  business remains orderly
mr
smith  mr
nixon  comment
mr
nixon  yes
think mr
novins referring one senator person 's speeches  democratic platform  mention cutting national debt
think   pointed course possible  particularly proposals senator person advocated  either cut national debt reduce taxes
matter fact necessary raise taxes
senator person points far one proposal concerned - one medical care aged - would financed social security
however  raising taxes pay social security
points would make pay-as-you-go basis natural resources development
natural resources development - also support  location  however - whenever uh - uh - - - uh - appropriates money one projects  pay appropriate money eh - eventually pay  doesn ' mean - government doesn ' put money year
would say proposals senator person made  result one two things  either raise taxes unbalance budget
unbalances budget  means inflation   course  cruel blow people - older people - 've talking
far aid school construction concerned  favor  senator person  january year  said favored rather aid - teacher salaries
favor believe 's best way aid schools without running risk whatever federal government telling teachers teach
mr
smith  next question vice president person mr
warren
mr
warren  mr
vice president mentioned schools yesterday think asked crash program raise education standards  evening talked advances education
mr
vice president  said - back number - salaries paid school teachers nothing short national disgrace
higher salaries teachers  added  important situation wasn ' corrected could lead national disaster
yet  refused vote senate order break tie vote single vote  yes  would granted salary increases teachers
wonder could explain  sir
mr
nixon  'm awfully glad ge - got question know got last question wasn ' able complete argument
uh - think reason voted federal government uh - pay teachers ' salaries probably reason concerned senator person january year  kick-off press conference  said favored aid school construction  time feel aid teachers ' salaries - least 's way read remarks
question federal government aiding - teachers ' salaries
senator person take position
take
took  take  reason  want higher teachers ' salaries
need higher teachers ' salaries
also want education free federal control
federal government gets power pay teachers  inevitably opinion  acquire power set standards tell teachers teach
think would bad country ; think would bad teaching profession
another point made
favor higher salaries teachers
senator person said january year press conference  way get higher salaries teachers support school construction  means local school districts various states money freed raise standards teachers ' salaries
also point ; put responsibility federal government paying portion teachers ' salaries  local communities states going meet responsibility much
believe  words  seen local communities state assuming responsibility
teachers ' salaries fortunately gone fifty percent last eight years thirty-four percent rise salaries
enough ;
believe way get salaries teachers federal government get massive program
objection cost dollar
objection potential cost controls eventual freedom american people giving federal government power education  greatest power government
mr
smith  senator person 's comment
mr
kennedy  uh - vice president quotes january  sixty  believe federal government pay directly teachers ' salaries  issue senate february
issue senate money would given state
state could determine whether money would spent school construction teacher salaries
question vice president disagreed
voted favor proposal supported strongly  think provided assistance teachers salaries without chance federal control vote th - mr
nixon disagreed  tie vote uh - defeated breaking tie defeated proposal
' want federal government paying teachers ' salaries directly
money go states states determine whether shall go school construction teachers ' salaries  opinion protect local authority school board school committee
therefore think sound proposal supported regret pass
secondly  statements made uh - democratic platform would cost good deal money favor unbalancing budget
wholly wrong  wholly error  fact last eight years democratic congress reduced appropri - requests appropriations ten billion dollar
view think ought stated clearly record
view programs - carefully drawn - within balanced budget economy moving ahead
mr
smith  next question senator person mr
vanocur
mr
vanocur  senator  've promising voters elected president 'll try push congress bills medical aid aged  comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill  federal aid education
august post-convention session congress  least held possibility could one day president overwhelming majorities  especially senate  could get action bills
feel 'll able get january - mr
kennedy  well take bills - mr
vanocur  - weren ' able get august
mr
kennedy  may take bills  pass senate bill uh - provide dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage
failed house pass house failed eleven votes
might say two-thirds republicans house voted dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage majority democrats sustained - nearly two-thirds voted dollar twenty-five
threatened veto passed dollar quarter - 's extremely difficult great power president pass bill president opposed
president needs sustain veto bill one-third plus one either house senate
secondly  passed federal aid education bill senate
failed came floor house representatives
killed rules committee
fact august session four members rules committee republicans joining two democrats voted sending aid education bill floor house
four democrats voted
every republican rules committee voted sending bill considered members house representatives
thirdly  medical care aged  fight 's going twenty-five years social security
wanted tie social security
offered amendment
forty-four democrats voted  one republican voted
informed time came vote adopted president location location would veto
judgment  vigorous democratic president supported democratic majority house senate win support programs
send republican president democratic majority threat veto hangs congress  judgment continue happened august session  clash parties inaction
mr
smith  mr
nixon  comment
mr
nixon  well obviously views little different
first  ' see 's possible one-third body  republicans house senate stop two-thirds  two-thirds adequately led
would say   senator person refers action house rules committee  eight democrats committee four republicans
would seem difficult blame four republicans eight democrats ' getting something particular committee
would say blame president veto power inability senator colleagues get action special session uh - misses mark
president exercises veto power  people upo - behind  third congress
let 's consider
majority members congress felt particular proposals good issues - majority democrats - didn ' pass send president get veto issue
reason particular bills various fields mentioned passed president ; people
extreme
convinced alternate proposals  republicans field health  field education  field welfare  extreme  accomplish end uh - without great cost dollar freedom  could get next congress
mr
smith  next question vice president person fa - mr
fleming
mr
fleming  mr
vice president  take believe work better democratic majorities house senate senator person could work democratic majorities house senate
mr
nixon ; would say   course  expect pick seats house senate
uh - would hope control house  get majority house uh - election
can not  course  control senate
would say president able lead - president able get program - effect support country  support people
sometimes - get opinion getting programs house senate 's purely question legislative finagling sort thing
isn ' really
whenever majority people program  house senate responds
whether house senate  next session democratic republican  country voted candidate presidency proposals made  believe find president  republican  would case  would able get program congress
also say far senator person 's proposals concerned    question simply one uh - presidential veto stopping programs
must always remember president ' stop anything unless people behind
reason president person 's vetoes sustained - reason congress send bills think vetoed - people congress  majority  know country behind president
mr
smith  senator person
mr
kennedy  well  let 's look bills vice president suggests extreme
one bill dollar twenty-five cents hour anyone works store company million dollar year business
' think 's extreme ; yet nearly two-thirds three-fourths republicans house representatives voted proposal
secondly federal aid education bill
- uh - defeat teacher salaries  bill uh - met opinion need
fact matter bill less recommended  mr
nixon  morning proposal
extreme bill yet could get one republican join  least think four eight democrats voted send floor house - one republican - joined democrats opposed
' say democrats united support program
say majority
say majority republicans opposed
third medical care aged location tied social security  financed social security funds
put deficit treasury
proposal advanced mr
javits would cost six hundred millions dollar - mr
rockefeller rejected location location  said didn ' agree financing  said ought social security
three programs quite moderate
think shows difference two parties
one party ready move programs
party gives lip service
mr
smith  mr
warren 's question senator person
mr
warren  senator person  another subject  communism often described ideology belief exists somewhere location location
let ask  sir  serious threat national security communist subversive activities location location today
mr
kennedy  well  think 're serious
think 's matter continue uh - give uh - great care attention
support uh - laws location location passed order protect us uh - would destroy us within
sustain uh - department justice efforts fbi
continually alert
think location location maintaining strong society location location  think meet internal threat
major threat external continue
mr
smith  mr
nixon  comment
mr
nixon  agree senator person 's appraisal generally respect
question communism within location location one worried us past
one continue problem years come
remember cold war mr
person waging colleagues waging  waged world 's waged right location location
's continue alert
also essential alert fair ; fair fair uphold freedoms communists would destroy
uphold standards conduct would never follow
connection  think uh - must look future mind fact fight communism home laws deal communists uh - become communists become tra - fellow travelers  also fight communism home moving various injustices exist society communists feed upon
connection would say senator person says status quo  believe uh - would agree sincere believing proposals federal aid education  proposals health care sincerely held
question one goals - 're goals - 's one means
mr
smith  mr
vanocur 's question vice president person
mr
vanocur  mr
vice president uh - one earlier statements said 've moved ahead  've built schools  've built hospitals
sir  isn ' true building schools local matter financing
uh - claiming eisenhower administration responsible building schools  local school districts provide
mr
nixon
matter fact question brings point glad make
often appraising whether moving ahead think federal government
isn ' test whether location moves
test whether location moves whether federal government  plus state government  plus local government  plus biggest segment - individual enterprise - moves
example gross national product approximately five hundred billion dollar
roughly hundred billion hundred quarter billion result government activity
four hundred billion  approximately  result individuals
reason eisenhower administration moved  reason 've funds  example  locally build schools  hospitals  highways  make progress  administration encouraged individual enterprise ; resulted greatest expansion private sector economy ever witnessed eight-year period
growth
growth looking ; growth administration supported policies stimulated
mr
smith  senator person
mr
kennedy  well  must say reason schools constructed local school districts willing increase property taxes tremendously high figure - opinion  almost point diminishing returns order sustain schools
secondly  think rich uh - country
think powerful country
think  however  president leadership set country exactly must next decade  're going maintain security education  economic growth  development natural resources
location location making great gains
isn ' enough compare might done eight years ago  ten years ago  fifteen years ago  twenty years ago
want compare 're adversaries  year number location location ahead education  health  building  homes  economic strength
think 's big assignment  big task  big function federal government
mr
smith  summation time please
've completed questions comments  moment  'll summation time
voice  allow three minutes twenty seconds summation candidate
mr
smnumberth  three minutes twenty seconds candidate
vice president person  make first summation
mr
nixon  thank  mr
person
senator person
first  think well put perspective really stand regard location location whole matter growth
location location moving faster
reason obvious
start much lower base
although moving faster growth  find  example  today total gross national product forty-four per cent total gross national product
's percentage twenty years ago
far absolute gap concerned  find location location even ahead twenty years ago
reason complacency
determined men
fanatical men
get uh - uh - economy
agree senator person completely score
disagree means would use get economy
respectfully submit senator person often would rely much federal government  would solve problems  stimulate growth
believe examine democratic platform  examine proposals discussed tonight  compare proposals made  proposals makes would result greater growth country would case followed programs advocated
many points made would like comment upon
one field health worth mentioning
health program - one senator javits republican senators  well supported - one provides people sixty-five want health insurance  opportunity want
provides choice either government insurance private insurance
compels nobody insurance want
program social security  would require everybody social security take government health insurance whether wanted
would cover several million people covered social security
one place think program better job
point would make  downgrading much things cost think many people understand better look happened - truman administration government spending took - found savings lifetime eaten inflation
found people could least afford - people retired incomes uh - people fixed incomes - found unable meet bills end month
essential man 's president country certainly stand every program mean growth
stand programs mean growth progress
also essential allow dollar spent could better spent people
mr
smith  senator person  conclusion
mr
kennedy  point made mr
nixon soviet production forty-four percent
must say forty-four percent soviet country causing us good deal trouble tonight
want make sure stays relationship
' want see day 's sixty percent  seventy seventy-five eighty ninety percent  force power could bring bear order cause destruction
secondly  vice president mentioned medical care aged
program amendment person bill
person bill provided assistance social security
think 's clear contrast
number  social security act written  ninety-four ninety-five republicans voted
mr
person ran number repeal
august number  tried get  time medical care  received support one republican senate occasion
thirdly  think question american people  look country look world around  goals americans
means question
means issue
feel everything done satisfactory  relative power prestige strength location location increasing relation communists ; 've b - gaining security  achieving everything nation achieve  achieving better life citizens greater strength  agree
think vote mr
nixon
feel move sixties  function president set people unfinished business society person person thirties  agenda people - must society meet needs country protect security help cause freedom
said beginning  question us  faces republicans democrats   freedom next generation conquer  communists going successful
's great issue
meet responsibilities think freedom conquer
fail  fail move ahead  fail develop sufficient military economic social strength country  think uh - tide could begin run us
' want historians  ten years  say  years tide ran location location
want say years tide came ; years location location started move
's question american people  decide want  want country  want future
think 're ready move
great task  're successful  address
mr
smith  thank much  gentlemen

thank much permitting us present next president location location unique program
