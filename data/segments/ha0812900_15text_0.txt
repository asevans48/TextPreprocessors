see update governor person 's response
person person offered strange analysis national priorities conference diabetes location
told audience diabetes presents bigger threat americans terrorism  true utterly pointless time
also underscored suspicion republican primary voters nanny-state tendencies ( via jwf )  'm dispute fact diabetes terrible disease
first mate diabetes forty years got pancreas transplant number
blinded  caused kidney disease led three kidney transplants  gave degenerative neuropathy plagues day
live consequences every day
millions americans suffer diabetes one form another  makes huckabee 's terrorism comparison technically correct
however  diabetes control isn ' primary responsibility federal government
national security
diabetes manageable disease  terrorism isn '
tolerable level terrorism exists nation
federal government constitutional responsibility protect us attack  terrorist otherwise
people responsibility managing illnesses maintaining health
huckabee forgot distinction times campaign  sounding like nanny-state politician bent imposing health-related mandates federal level  sounds like still hasn ' learned difference
update  received e-mail governor person number pm ct today following response  've interviewed gov huckabee occasions found intelligent  honest  refreshing
think  though  demonstrates conducting rhetorical comparisons anything terrorism problematic
put terms  implies kind action taken government
otherwise  use terrorism
compare diabetes alcohol addiction  aids  high-school dropout rates  etc
noted first paragraph  comparison would apt statistically  implication goes much farther think honestly intended
however  governor notes response  diabetes require action individuals lower risks disease  including better diet  exercise  move away high-sugar foods
people political life  governor best standing make point 's point us support
