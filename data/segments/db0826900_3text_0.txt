slap happyby digbyin case 're getting confused ( 'm talking politics ! )
's person merits deal  $ number billion slap facethe initial treasury stance bailout one sheer demand authority  give us total discretion blank check  'll fix things
explanation theory case believe proposed intervention would work
many us turned analyses  concluded probably wouldn ' work unless amounted huge giveaway financial industry
duress  person person ( paulson ! )
offered explanation sorts missing theory
effect  metastasized version slap-in-the-face theory failed resolve crisis far
explain apparent logic  let 's talk governments normally respond financial crisis  namely  rescue failing financial institutions  taking temporary ownership keeping running
' want keep institutions public  eventually dispose bad assets pay enough debt make institutions viable  sell back private sector
first step rescue ownership
's s & l crisis ; 's location early numbers ; 's done fannie freddie ; 's even done last week aig
's less would happen person plan  would buy bad debt get equity warrants depend later losses debt
paulson bernanke proposing  nearly  opposite  want buy bad paper everyone  institutions trouble  taking ownership
fact  've said ' want equity warrants precisely would lead financial institutions aren ' trouble stay away
're talking bailout specifically designed funnel money ' need
took four days p & b offered explanation whatsoever logic
seems argument runs like  mortgage-related assets currently sold fire-sale prices  ' reflect true  hold maturity value ; 're going pay true value make everyone 's balance sheet look better restore confidence markets
said  really giant version slap-in-the-face theory  markets getting hysterical  feds calm buying everyone else selling
three points  number
're still offering something nothing
major financial crises  beginning end comes government accepts pay cost recapitalize banks
case 're still insisting 's basically confidence problem  wave magic wand $ number billion magic wand  's impress people whole thing go away
number
're asserting treasury fed know true values better market
fair  's possible  maybe even probable  mortgage-related paper sold cheaply
sure
plenty cash-rich private investors ; many buying mbs
isn ' bizarre officials miscalled much signs look  declared paulson april number  show housing market near bottom confidently declaring know better market broad class securities worth
number
even works  system remain badly undercapitalized
realistic estimates say $ number billion real  medium-term fire-sale losses home mortgages
around $ number billion acknowledged financial institutions far
even fire-sale discount removed  'll still crippled system
person offering nothing fix unless ends paying much paper worth  standard
meanwhile  person bernanke seem digging heels equity warrants anything else would make standard financial rescue
say deal terms lack deal puts financial world strain  blame person person  wasted week demanding authority without explanation
's
obviously `` plan `` whatever  changed congressional negotiators
central premise doesn ' appear
throw huge amount money willy nilly market slap hysteria
's supposed work 've spent past week running around like chicken little head cut  ' really know
person 's right  isn ' plan
's crude psychological experiment
