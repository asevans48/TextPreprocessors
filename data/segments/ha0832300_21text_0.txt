piracy indian ocean took significant turn worse
misc tanker holding equivalent number % nation 's daily output got seized pirates  presumably location  far normal zone risk
seizure raises questions safety  ecology  security energy transport  financial times speculates pirates demand ransom  usual end result piracy region
may difficult time getting cash  however
pirates usually seize cargo ships tankers  difficult captain can not use normal docks frequented pirates
tankers ride low water  danger grounding real  especially inexperienced pilots
ecological destruction could surpass organization organization  half capacity sirius star
assumes  course  pirates want tanker ransom
person seems strange pirates target food aid closer shore would go far way oil tanker
value much higher  course one expert says hit jackpot crew safety rather cargo value main driver ransoms
'd probably get amount money  taking much higher risk ship ' maneuver well
make sense
purpose could pirates use massive oil tanker
could seized terror weapon
sailed harbor detonated  tanker size could massive damage  especially oil-exporting port could send shock waves throughout energy industry months  years
sinking could block exports weeks salvage crews cleared wreckage
hopefully  us navy forces intercept sirius star pirates attempt navigate anywhere close port negotiate release crew ship
rumblings organization plots coming location  particular act piracy bears close watch
update  made clear initial post
crude board won ' explode refined make flammable enough kind power
location  pirates/terrorists could load enough explosives create havoc sails port  blocking access damaging facilities badly enough make unusable
kind operation planned  would brought enough explosives board seizure ship make work
plus  tanker would fuel use capacity well
