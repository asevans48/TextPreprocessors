via weasel zippers  read story twice figure objection
students forced say pledge
's unconstitutional number years
atheists objecting god bit said public classroom
nope  either
's still open question legally  's hint anyone quoted article 's issue
objection appears kids ' want say might feel peer pressure surrounded
school 's logical solution
everything  including physical segregation  call attention students
nuance  religious element case  think  albeit subtextually
one legacies banning prayer schools paranoia hint religious indoctrination ; atheist ' resist joining choir people around pray never much atheist begin  total ban prayer least legally defensible given special worry state religion first amendment
school apparently wanted adapt zero-tolerance anti-indoctrination principle situation  er  isn ' zero tolerance ( since   retain pledge )
hence idiocy initial outcome  honest goodness quarantine non-pledging students morning isolate sort scorn 'd surely subjected later
idiocy eventual compromise solution  decidedly zero tolerance  better way make dissenters feel comfortable turn daily pledge mass gathering/panopticon aimed squarely anxiety
apropos nothing  's person person person person completely misunderstanding case yesterday fox
exit question  sort wave schoolyard beatings saying pledge haven ' heard
stand ' say ' want rule seems worked okay last six half decades
