moderator  mr

location caldron political bickering partisanship
american people  gentleman  enough
would elevate political discourse purpose
cheney  well  think number ways
first  agree assessment

moderator  senator  sexual orientation
male loves male female loves female - - constitutional rights enjoyed every american citizen
lieberman  current difficult question
've thinking

maybe begin answer going back beginning country declaration independence says outset us created equal 're endowed bunch politicians philosophers  creator  inalienable rights life  liberty pursuit happiness
beginning history  promise ideal realized experienced americans  time since extended orbit promise
time frontier effort extending kinds rights gay lesbian americans citizens country children awesome god much rest us
