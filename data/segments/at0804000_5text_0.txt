person person expertly explains vast highly visible chasm two parties comes fundamental principles  national review online
republicans driven issues  democrats driven feelings based group identity
[ democrats ' ] debate almost entirely theoretical  drowned mad scramble assemble misc coalition generic `` hispanics  `` `` blacks  `` `` white women  `` etc
's amazing complacent media carrying kind nakedly reductionist analysis
notion hispanics may voting one way another reasons ethnicity seems never come
meanwhile  republican side  women  blacks hispanics vote  's demographics coalitions right work
gop candidates actually win people believe things
(  famed  tragically frayed  `` reagan coalition `` different groups principled people  mere hodgepodge ethnicities genders  )
exit pollsters ask gop voters whether 're committed pro-lifers  whether think economy important issue  etc
'm sure ask democratic voters similar questions  's telling little hear
democratic voters actually believe doesn ' seem relevant  large part democrats aren ' voting beliefs  're voting affections
election cycle  gop opportunity prove difference larger group voters past  bitter battle democrats ' side expose ugly truth party 's genuine operating principles
