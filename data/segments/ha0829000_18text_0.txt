presidential debate analysis complete without judging moderation
person person cbs moderated debate last night appeared well  least getting two men argue
appear significant time differentials last word issues
fact  time thought person 's peformance last night asked abortion topic inexplicably avoided three previous debate moderators
previous debates  bias demonstrated questions
according person person 's transcript  schieffer 's questions  one could claim lack foreign-policy questions hurt person  two participants agreed weeks ago focus domestic-policy issues debate
person stuck plan ; major foreign-policy crisis reared head last days  probably would included  didn '
' see particular bias  soft otherwise  question selection wording
fact  surprised hear issue abortion raised  although notice gun control didn ' come

first word/last word dynamic actually rather interesting
nine topics  person gave person first word five times person four
person  however  stayed aggressive got last word seven nine topics  including zinger last question  didn ' see clear evidence bias person 's performance
thought credible job moderator  probably better expected
managed keep lively without excessively interfering exchanges
