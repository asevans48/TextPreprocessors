tell  drawing hopelessly confused
dont get wrong  followed pz 's lucid explanation squid/human differences perfectly  grokked later explanation drawing seemed depend much colors
drawing subtleties offer pz 's text  completely missed
would think using bold  distinctive colors scientific visual material would kind no-brainer
would wrong
three person person 's beautiful books visual design information  discuss color  never mentions  far recall  choosing color schemes minimize confusion related color-blindness
maybe takes consideration new book
frankly  doubt
aberrant incident  single over-caffeinated graphic artist digging latest iteration photoshop
number number years ago  color schemes scientific american got confusing  wrote somewhat humorous letter complain literally couldn ' make head tail charts
received nice reply  apology promise take color blindness account future graphics
miracle miracles  several years  color coding dramatically improved reverting back occasional head scratcher
really  'm simply low level science fan ; 's big deal amateur ' tell magenta cyan
know sheer havoc caused field - music - changed color coding stereo wires cables red green red white
anyone 's hooked stereo components phase inkling problem - sometimes  studio  've make literally hundreds connections
fun trying puzzle wire red green times number plus  especially less ideal light
given many male scientists  doctors  engineers  etc  etc  ( disproportionate number males professions another post ) given significant fraction males must color blind ( number % trivial percentage )  would guess  serious mistakes could avoided simply using less ambiguous color codings
'm trying stifle creativity visual design information
go ahead  use magenta care
heaven 's sakes  please contrast brown cyan eye-melting yellows  bright oranges  bluest blues side paradise
