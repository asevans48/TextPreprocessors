location location may soon deputize garbage collectors inspecting refuse hauling away
residents fail compost food waste could find fined thousand dollar without garbage service  new proposal mayor person person  stupidity extends several levels
first  let 's look practical implications regulatory regime
trash collection requires efficient use vehicles personnel
sanitation workers stop inspect every barrel dumpster compliance  make entire process much labor intensive require expansion collection vehicles
would cost prohibitive  increase idling vehicles waiting inspections end moving next stop would actually make emissions even worse
next  one enforce compliance multi-tenant dwellings
apartments condos usually use communal dumpsters rather individual barrels  efficiency
garbage unsorted  gets fined tenants landlords
neither one could proven responsible misdemeanor court
landlords risk fines suspension service tenant behavior can not possibly control  even trace  expect property values take dive people sell assets real estate
philosophically speaking  represents gross intrusion ( one sense word ) government private life
recycling plans work 're voluntary ; people ' mind simple sorting process involving one bin refuse another recyclables
required start using three  four  five bins sorting trash upon threat prosecution  good compliance end people stop recycling altogether
wait municipal courts get flooded accused looking clear good names avoid $ number fine
plus  garbage collectors even levy citations without sworn officers law least employed law enforcement
's yet another nutty idea location 's leading source
'd give even odds passage
