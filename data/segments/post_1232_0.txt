enjoy discussion 's civility  keep going least one
representation college overall actually like number/number female/male college  even stronger soon
representation translate hard sciences engineering  yet  though
yes  indeed  science classes passing males females equally  issue interest subjects  ability
men women amazing sciences  person person comes immediately mind   issue sex 's interest
men wired differently heads females scientifically proven
propensity certain worldviews abilities greater men things greater women things
sure still incidences sexism workplace academics  sad
reason massive disparity hard sciences though
bring victorians lot  sadly child abuse
still probably always flawed world
remember  though  ancient egyptians even tribes way farther back virtually ability  knowledge less
evolutionarily  evolved much abilities relatively tiny scope time civilization
considering  despite anecdotes victorian age  children purpose marriage supported family family grew older supported parents unable hard labor anymore farms  etc
truly today luxury focus unseen human history  remove purpose marriage means produce children throughout history
reason number + years humanity chosen man/woman marriage optimum situation  despite difficulties
course specific instances point changes  arguing exception rule silly
realize many extremely emotional issue ( reasoning give same-sex marriage rights purely compassionate )  commend ability clear
appreciate  ' seem find many discuss clearly
hope least drive home frame chosen see issue understand half america ( ) opposes same-sex marriage
bigoted hateful reasons ( 's easy way instead discussions )
want traditional marriage held model family optimal situation raise child
society chooses longer value specific life choices others  descend chaos
thanks
