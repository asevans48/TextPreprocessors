whereas yesterday state department wondering happened  another spokesman dismissing incident misunderstanding
's tough section border  way
ajo  location right near organ pipe cactus national monument  park ranger person person killed cartel hit squad number
new study shows  section border still undermanned relative location
okaytwo thoughts
first  're giving misc government billions dollar aid organization initiative improve effectiveness mexican military law enforcement
maybe could throw couple hand-held gps devices
even build signal makes beep loudly 're inside us territory
's temporary solution
's radical new idea 'd like proposemaybe could build sort ofhmmmstructure along us/mexico border
something would make difficult physically pass location location location  vice-versa
bear  let run crazy idea flagpole see salutes  unlike virtual fences even increased patrolling  one barrier watchamacallits would actually prevent sort dangerous accident would really working hard end side thewall-like obstruction
'd also worry less confusing hikers area residents drug runners coyotes
would less
'd find another way country  coyotes might even go business would become expensive keep bringing people versus could make illegal labor
hey  's another fringe benefit
wow  sounding like good idea
could even cool catch phrase could tell congressmansomething like build reinforced border obstacle !
