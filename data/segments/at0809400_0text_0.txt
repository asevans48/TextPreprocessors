web site sadly  commented article `` typical white fact-based reasoning `` piece called fun figures follows
sadly-mistitled [ sic ] website american thinker wingnuts fancy really  really smart go play
's find person person  engineer living hinterlands location  pulling slide rule explain white people right poop pants see black people
statistics show  person says flourish pocket protector  black people likely murderers white people
chance person see street murdering someone year number number ( assuming see random sample people )
chance white person numbernumber number
chance black person numbernumber number
means black person numbernumber times likely white person murderer
totally rational person ( including person person person person 's grandmother ) fear black person white one
fact  fear numbernumber times
interesting facts take account determining afraid
number times likely drown bathtub bitten venomous spider 's totally rational afraid bathtubs
three times likely killed acquaintance total stranger  really need spend time strangers  safe
write post like one hoven wrote  number times likely get linked person person
sadly  comments article misc thinkerwere misguided
true people likely murdered members race  indeed friends acquaintances
mean fear race
necessarily
person also true car accidents occur within number miles home
move
logic applies
likely accident near home driving near home
likely murdered member race contacts members race
situation person person 's grandmother  type situation addressed  conditioned meeting stranger street bus
likelihood contact already taken equation
race thing know person street  person black  number number chance murder someone year
person black  chance less number number
ratio number  number  likelihood person murderer number % greater person black black
( `` everything else equal  ``
) perhaps think chances small either way none matters  even deciding whether cross street  lock car doors  take bus
let give two examples might illustrate
number people per year die drivers passengers cars population number million
chance dying car wreck year number number
similar chance murdered  number number number recent years  much higher blacks
( include violent crimes  chance victim would far higher chance dying car accident  )
government claims airbags reduce fatalities number %
factor number  number %
airbag  chance dying would go number number number numberfor sliver difference  government mandated air bags cars
see chance dying car accident similar chance murdered  much lower chance victim type violent crime
lowering chance number %  number life number reason enough government mandate airbags
compare number % difference number % difference stranger/murderer situation
second example medical
chance dying heart attack year pretty small
doctor prescribed pill said would lower chances dying heart attack number %
chance dying heart attack might go number number number number
( number % reduction actually factor numbernumber  number % increase viewed increase risk pill taken  )
levels absolute risk par stranger/murder case  difference number number lives saved number ( number airbag case  number pill case )
difference stranger/murder case number number
remember  numbers murder  violent crime
government  businesses individuals make behavior-altering decisions based levels absolute relative risk lower situation examined  considered quite `` rational ``
person 's threshold fear ( point behavior would change )  person  make prescriptions
factor number ( number % ) large relative difference  much larger number % difference sufficient government change behavior airbag case number % difference doctor pill case
see nothing irrational bigoted simple passive behaviors crossing street locking car doors meeting stranger street  even race deciding factor decision
bathtubs  irrational fear either
's one reason people sell people use non-slip rubber mats put
personally fears
government making many behavioral decisions
must wear seatbelt wherever drive
must wear helmet riding motorcycle many states
state can not smoke bars anywhere private residences
eleven vaccines mandated newborns  including diseases extremely low mortality rates  especially infants
amuses slightly find rational fears  acted privately  derided many people willing mandate behavior many cases  especially ones less `` rational `` based solid risk analysis
let try simplify even
suppose found number % traffic fatalities happened fords  yet fords comprise number % vehicles road
would less inclined buy ford knew
would think government investigate situation
would consider decisions rational  bigoted fords
