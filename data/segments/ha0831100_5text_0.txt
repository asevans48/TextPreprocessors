decided take look website incoming person person administration  office president-elect organization looks awful lot like campaign site
person announces change come america  even though person still two months taking oath office
's replete campaign slogans location  economy  issues
none terribly new  looks like got transplanted barackobama
com
however  site
gov top-level domain ( change
gov )
reserved qualified government organizations programs
incoming administration technically status government organization program january number  number
office president-elect doesn ' exist within government
furthermore  use seen site clearly promotional person person person person  kept campaign domain rather set official us government site
using
gov site compile mailing lists
government need collect e-mails addresses citizens order share stories president-elect
purpose ope information
hoping build list sell political allies  perhaps telemarketers help pay deficit
since hosted government site  think need explain official use make information
're going perpetual campaign next administration  could least decency use private-sector domain name
