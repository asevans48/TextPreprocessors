think armstrong fladem completely discounting fact edwards poised stay race convention  series third-place finishes person potentially skips location location location retool  cumulative effect
also  going relentlessly negative dumb strategy view
person actually decent enough message  good enough win  looking petty blaming media derail
also extremely damaging democratic party heading important tough general election  's beyond candidate would even consider going nuclear  cynical candidate running hope
reinforces person 's argument  )
've come conclusion democratic candidate  get white house  less material harnesses growing movement toward progressive solutions challenges face
think top three could task
's  however  tap movement
let 's clear
location open primary sense same-day registration
one independent republican voted person person iowa ; sign democrats
lot young voters ' political party self-identify ideologically progressives
bipartisan post-partisan movement
movement invests lot power one man push progressive agenda
barack obama starting acknowledge  relief many thought wasn ' giving progressive movement ability help set agenda
obama 's speech underwent another subtle shift
much emphasis placed word `` progressive  `` much explicit recognition person 's potential meaning particular ideological movement
spoke `` independents recognize current course 're working  ready form coalition democrats progressive change  `` chided observers said way diverse individuals would turn `` progressive misc  ``
've heard word oft-repeated rallies

called `` cynics `` believing stated goals number-year conservative movement  destroy government  make progress never happen  stymie efforts direction
absolutely reason think continue manner
's thing 're successful  message discipline ability stick together near-legendary
media isn ' likely make pay price  either
happens
right already smugly saying may worried person politically  legislative standpoint  ``
believes 's game-changer  ' believe game changed  `` said rep
person person ( okla  )
chairman national republican congressional committee  dismissing person 's transformational pledges naive  ``
