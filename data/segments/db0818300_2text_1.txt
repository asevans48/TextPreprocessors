important rank file democrats national leaders ( none facing tough re-election battles ) understood important issue take stand
every last democratic presidential hopeful senate took dive
cowardlycya-for-the-future-because-the-big-bad-republicans-will-be-mean vote took starch right democratic base made thousands calls wrote thousands letters veritably begging leading dems hold tough issue
democratic electoral momentum leading election hit brick wall caved
thank vaunted political strategists person  person person incredible miscalculation  according memo  effective argument democrats oppose war one `` affirms one 's commitment wage war terrorism  including getting rid person 's weapons mass destruction  questions rush war ; calls us seek un international support  others sharing costs making sure achieve greater stability  ``
