person follows comrade-in-arms person person  also got paroled number months ago  grounds  eh
fact person served less year prison every person group murdered
number  person found personally guilty nine murders number attempted murders
gives less three years murders  attempts ignored altogether
people say mistrust law-enforcement approach terrorism  exactly mean
