rep
harman want npt 's shortcomings
okayso  um  let un make world 's enriched uranium ration
long un manages turn atoms peace oil food ii
importantly  ' hear anything would actually discourage country like location north korea enriching uranium  making pinky swear organization won ' itand countries already broken word subject
see  npt fine worried non-rogue states acquiring nukes
location decided probably needs nuclear arsenal  might stopped fact signed npt made commitment international community acquire nuclear weapons even though wanted
nice non-rogue country like finland cares things  see
npt didn ' stop finalnd  well  's still location
'd rather didn ' h-bombs riding icbm 's  even  's ( god forbid ) bright flash times square used  first place look culprit going location
meanwhile  look toward location location either never joined npt regime  left ( like organization )  cheating like person blind wife ( location )
' care international law except insofar legitimizes protects regimes
location 's signature npt reassure
course subnational groupse
g  organization organization  misc mob  aren ' bound npt
rep
harman 's right npt doesn ' protect us well
alternative plan sounds like democrat version 've called faith-based non-proliferation policy  trusts north koreans ( saudis ) 's interests instead  presumably goodness hearts
