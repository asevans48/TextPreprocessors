person spoke number years ago  position
number months ago  believed
fifteen months ago  cosigner advocating tax cut proposing  said would forward step fighting inflation  would beneficial working people country
moyers  next question goes mr
reagan person person
person  syndicated columnist  well  gentlemen  'd like say first  think panel audience would appreciate responsiveness questions  rather repetitions campaign addresses
question governor  every serious examination future supply energy essential resources - including air  land water - finds face shortages skyrocketing prices   many ways  're pushing environment dangerous limits
'd like know  specifically  changes would encourage require american lifestyles automobile use  housing  land use general consumption  meet problems aren ' going respond campaign lullabies minor conservation efforts production
reagan  well  believe conservation  course  worthy
anything would preserve  help us use less energy  would fine  'm
believe conservation alone answer present energy problem  're staving  short time  day would come end energy supply
say limited  dangerous point country regard energy  think  ignore fact
fact  today 's oil wells  oil still far taken used
would require known secondary tertiary efforts bring ground
known oil reserves  known supplies
hundreds millions acres land taken circulation government whatever reason  believed knowledgeable oil geologists contain probably oil natural gas used far since drilled first well number years ago
coal supply equal number % world 's coal supply  good centuries  country
grant prices may go  go go deeper  adding cost production
nuclear power   believe  safest
stringent safety requirements  could meet energy needs next couple decades go forward exploring areas solar power forms energy might renewable would exhaustible
things done
stop think drilling number %
leased number % possible
possibility oil continental shelf around united states ; stop think government taken number million acres land circulation location  alone  believed geologists contain much line minerals energy sources  think government  government restrictions regulations  creating energy crisis
indeed  energy-rich nation
moyers  would like say point candidates requested questions repeated  sake precision  part interrogator
mr
person  may address mr
anderson
person  mr
anderson  'd like know specifically  changes would encourage require american lifestyles automobile use  housing  land use consumption  meet problems aren ' going respond campaign lullabies minor conservation efforts production
anderson  well  mr
person  simply can not allow go unpassed statements made mr
reagan   demonstrated  think  total misunderstanding energy crisis confronts  country  world  suggests number years ' supply natural gas  number years ' supply oil  rest  really
get government back oil industry  's going enough
agree think major premise question  sir  going create new conservation ethic minds american people
's simply proposed  number months ago  emergency excise tax gasoline
security measure sure  would rather see us reduce consumption imported oil send misc boys fight misc gulf
time  think 's going take dramatic measure kind convince american people reduce use private automobile
simply can not people sitting one behind wheel car long traffic jams going great cities
going resort van pooling  car pooling
're going develop better community transportation systems  buses light rail  replace private automobile places clearly energy-efficient
think  respect housing  consuming  even though per capita income today federal republic location  consuming  factor two  amount energy consume country
surely  things retrofitting  person redesign homes  houses  commercial structures  well  make possible us achieve
according one study published short time ago - organization business school study - indicated commercial sector alone economy  could save number % number % energy consume country today
think  yes  change appreciable way  lifestyles enjoy
moyers  mr
reagan
reagan  well  've said  enemy conservation
wouldn ' called conservative
figures challenged  president challenged made  think called attention person others figures figures department energy  overly optimistic recent years much supply left
government  number  told us enough oil left number years  number years later  told us enough left another number years
saving energy conserving  american people haven ' badly
industry today  're producing  last several years  number % less use energy back number
motorists using number % less back time oil embargo
think proving go forward conservation benefit
also  think safe say sources energy yet used found
moyers  mr
anderson
anderson  mr
person  think opponent debate tonight overlooking one important fact
can not look simply national problem
even though 's true  perhaps  end decade  total consumption oil may increase  perhaps  million number million barrels oil day
rest western world  told  may see consumption increase number million barrels number million
additional number million barrels going cause scarcity
going cause scarcity world markets least five reputable studies  one even american petroleum institute   think  clearly indicate somewhere along around end present decade  total world demand oil simply going exceed total available supplies
think conservation - think change lifestyles - necessary  better begin plan rather later
moyers  question goes  mr
anderson  person person
person person  military correspondent  sun  baltimore  mr
anderson  mr
reagan speak better defense
stronger defense programs would mean spending money
either  however  come grips fundamental problem manning forces  shall serve  burden distributed
surely critical issue next presidential term
oppose draft
questions  would fill under-strength combat forces numbers quality  without reviving conscription
commit   tonight  become commander chief  propose draft  however unpopular  becomes clear voluntary means working
anderson  mr
corddry  well aware present deficiencies armed forces country
report  recently  six number conus divisions country - continental location location army divisions - simply could pass readiness test  two three divisions allocated so-called rapid deployment force could meet readiness test
cases  failure meet test lack manning requirements  inability fill many slots divisions
yes  seen figures indicate perhaps september  number - month - shortage number ranks e-number e-number
reports
public reports long ago ships could leave american ports lack crews
talked one leading former chiefs naval operations office weeks ago  told number chief petty officers short
think clearly related fact  going back time all-volunteer army created number - worked hard supported - simply failed keep pace cost living
today  average  average serviceman least number % - happen think 's modest estimate - number % happened cost living period time
result  families young servicemen food stamps today
think 's shocking ; 's shameful
yes  told misc legion national !
convention  vfw national convention - spoke bodies - outlined specific program increasing pay allowances  reenlistment bonuses
makes sense
would leave thought  sir  quite specific answer question   course  protect vital interests country  became impossible ; could  despite best efforts asked congress put forward  raise pay incentives allowances  course  would leave country go undefended
moyers  mr
corddry
corddry  mr
reagan  repeat two questions  would fill under-strength combat forces numbers quality  without reviving conscription
commit ;  tonight  become commander chief  propose draft  however unpopular  becomes clear voluntary means solving manpower problems
reagan  mr
corddry  's shame two us debating  two agreement disagreement particular issue  one would disagreeing us president  present
i  believe voluntary military
matter fact  today shortages non-commissioned officers person mentioned tried draft today  wouldn ' non-commissioned officers train draftees
believe answer lies recognizing human nature make everything else work country  want work
recognize voluntary military
asking men women join military career  're asking deal sophisticated equipment
young man $ number billion carrier charge maintenance $ number million aircraft  working number hours week times  's earning less family  's away family  could earn one menial jobs  working number hours week home
aid enlistment
aid - number % people enlisted voluntary military number said one particular reason  gi
bill rights - fact  serving military  could provide future college education
number  took away military
meant immediately number % people signing reason signing
think case pay scale  recognizing 're going young men women responsible security  dealing sophisticated equipment  heaven 's sakes  let 's go pay scale commensurate sacrifice 're asking
along  think need something else allowed deteriorate
need million-man active reserve could called instant 's notice  would also trained  ready use type equipment
think  would respond proper kind incentives could offer people
day  - 'll hasten - saw one example
texas
saw high school military
moyers  time  mr
reagan
reagan  fine
moyers  'm sorry
reagan  'll catch later
moyers  finish 's
mr
anderson
anderson  mr
moyers
must say think better opportunity  however  finding necessary funds pay  admittedly   substantial sums money
signed one bill
passed one bill  couple weeks ago house representatives $ number million - half billion dollar
downpayment  opinion
unlike governor person  support boondoggle like mx missile
've gotten report air force indicates number-year lifecycle cost system going $ number billion
initial cost $ number billion  add additional costs - construction system  missiles personnel  - add additional costs lifecycle system  $ number billion
would propose save taxpayers country kind costly boondoggle
moyers  mr
reagan
reagan  well  let say  regard missile system  happen support believe missile
's $ number billion cost person talking
's talking fantastic plan administration take thousands thousands square miles western states
first  going dig racetrack going around racetrack would meet requirements salt ii treaty  's decided 'll straight thing  verifiable yet hideable location location
need missile  think  balance strategically lack deterrent possible first assault
favor plan costly
therefore  another second left  'd say high school class military training - number number graduates last year entered location location service academies ; west point  location air force academy  see young men made proud realize young people country prepared go kind career service country
moyers  question comes  mr
reagan  colleague  person may
lee may  staff writer  location location times - location bureau  mr
reagan  military area crisis
american cities physically wearing  housing  streets  sewers budgets fall apart
piled upon emotional strain comes refugees racial confrontations
'm wondering specific plans federal involvement saving cities physical emotional !
crises  would carry plans addition raising military pay  without going pledge fiscal restraint
reagan  ' think 'd go pledge
think one problems today cities federal aid
mayors 've talked leading cities tell !
federal grants come
specific cause specific objective  come red tape  priorities established bureaucracy location  local government 's hands tied regard using money feel could best used  think might top priority
money without government restrictions  every one told could make great savings make far greater use money
advocating  ' start federal government turning back tax sources states local governments  well responsibilities programs
seventy-five percent people live cities
' know city location doesn ' kind problems 're talking
getting money federal government putting help
new york taxed money go detroit
location taxed money  let 's say  go location  location taxed help problems location
wouldn ' make lot sense government let keep money first place
things inner cities  've believed
talked zones cities run  high percentage people welfare  offer tax incentives
government isn ' getting tax businesses aren '  individuals welfare rather working
' offer incentives business industry start zones
give tax moratorium period build develop
individuals would get jobs - give break encourages leave social welfare programs go work
could urban homestead act
've got thousands thousands homes owned government boarded  vandalized  taken mortgage foreclosures
homestead act  said people  $ number sell house
agree refurbish  make habitable  live - number years ago  open land country - urban
country homesteading
moyers  mr
may
may  mr
anderson  let ask  specific plans federal involvement saving cities physical emotional crises confront  would carry plans  addition raising military pay  without going pledge fiscal restraint
anderson  mr
may  recently saw organization organization study indicated cities america - large cities country - worse shape today number
seems totally belie claim heard president carter make days ago  first president come forth real urban strategy meet problems urban america
incidentally  past week  crown jewel program devised stolen  guess  conference committee turned ambitious plan increase amount money would available economic development administration loan guarantees direct loans credits
'm happy say  location  anderson-lucey platform location  program numbers  devoted considerable time  specific detail  talked two things ought done aid urban america
call  first  creation $ number billion urban reinvestment trust fund exactly spoke question - rebuild streets  rebuild cities  leaking water mains
north location - think weeks ago  campaign - water mains city begun leak  literally  wasn ' money available fix
begin recreate basic infrastructure great cities location  particularly upper midwest northeast  simply going provide kind economic climate enable retain industry  enable retain kind solid industrial base need  provide jobs
also provided program $ number billion community trust fund  've told money coming
's going come dedication  number  excise revenues today collected federal government alcohol tobacco
money  think  ought put rebuilding base cities
addition  jobs programs re-employ youth cities would high priority list  youth opportunities act number billion-dollar program would recommend put youth work energy projects  conservation projects  projects would carry great national goals country
moyers  mr
reagan  response
reagan  yes

john claims making plain money come
come pockets people
come pockets people living areas
problem  governments - federal  state local - taking $ number every dollar earned  federal government pre-empted many tax sources  cities
location money fix leaking water mains  's federal government pre-empted
federal government going turn around say  well problem ; hand money
federal government doesn ' make money
takes - people
view  answer problem
stand location location  spot person person made promise going  multi-billion dollar programs  refurbish area looks like bombed-out london world war ii
stood  met people
heard ask something would give hope
believe  promises broken  've never carried
believe plan might offer opportunity  would move areas let  encourage - tax incentive - private sector  develop create jobs people
moyers  mr
anderson
anderson  well  course  private sector  governor person  years cities deteriorating
seems deny responsibility federal government something crumbling cities deny opportunity one thing  number % black population country locked within inner cities metropolitan areas country
simply can not ignore fact  cities today  number % youth unemployment among black hispanic youth
