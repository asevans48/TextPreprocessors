operation hype hurricane  main eventby tristeroas mentioned two days ago  truly sickening perceive person marketing opportunity  way republicans act
kind public discourse
stands reason  therefore  democrats - serious winning elections - simply must respond effective manner
suggesting person fly new orleans get photographed levee  looking melodramatically concerned ( although wouldn ' care )
suggesting ceding discourse even moment republicans dangerous way run presidential campaign
like  feel free substitute word `` stupid `` `` dangerous `` previous sentence
surely  democratic pr people savvy enough come dignified presentation candidate 's involvement concern
( '  fired  )
yet  cede discourse exactly democrats done
one small example  even middle day yesterday  person 's website still touting brilliant acceptance speech failing mention person
morning ( eastcoast time )  urge compare person 's website person 's
person 's opens political message st
john  urges everyone put politics aside
click biiig button says `` take action  ``
person 's site respond
despite fact genuine moment national crisis  's personal message candidate
's link red cross
respective screens
like  times crisis  present political climate  marketing ops
person  takes place labor day weekend perfect opportunity candidates project leadership crisis
huge number eyeballs glued tv screens
watching person act like 's president person pushed side
democratic pr response completely unacceptable
via responses dday 's latest post  alarming one state new orleans levees  've learned many people think person loses nothing letting person prance unchallenged fake president
see major story person potential havoc storm wreak  cheap pr terms  ``
must show person something appears control  ``
makes better people i decent commentators truly worried person 's destructive power  disgusted person 's antics  applaud person staying completely way
even recognize could political advantage dignified ceding center stage
great sadness  completely disagree  although wish kind person didn ' find pr angle central
doubt  deeply relieved  response person far better person
nowhere near number people die happens today
also doubt media tight leash denied access atrocious destruction
think organization deployed new orleans
pictures dead bodies floating shit-filled floodwaters time
pr response person managed republicans tightly pr invasion location
regardless truth person 's destruction  appear person handled serious crisis  prevailed
one  assure  dare mention reality person could nothing substantive except get way
think get
point simple
us oppose person never  ever  permit far right define agenda
due tacit complicity democratic party
earlier summer  example  start location crisis
profoundly stupid mistake
person neck neck obama merely obvious reasons - racism  media bias  republican dirty tricks - also democrats won '  simply won '  recognize pr battle despite person 's commendable efforts cast otherwise
democrats fail realize obama surely knows  crisis  declaring oneself `` neither republican democrat `` blatantly partisan political stance
certainly  person pr advisers know seized opportunity democrats missed
okay  enough
person gone  posts politics
matter much better response person  serious situation
