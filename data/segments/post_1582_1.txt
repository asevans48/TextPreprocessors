hate play `` 'm right `` game
research  father leader mormon church
church members donated asked support legislature  church make political donations
'm sure catholics  're smart played way
agree churches heavily political ( ie
jeremiah wright  )
get politics taxed political entities
churches  however  right encourage voting moral issues ( 's actually law  believe )  churches silent political issues outside
won ' apologize opinion
real irony 'm even opposed gay marriage
'm opposed people anything get way  matter hurts
anyway  've heard point view
change minute anyone shows gay marriage protected constitutional right  vote passed
respect right believe whatever want  even respect right hate mock everyone disagrees ( thought ask respect right call hateful shallow bigot
yay free speech )
would honestly happy everyone say  look  disagree  right still friends  right 's happening


oh  still ' like courts usurping authority given constitution  )
