's good question
'll try explain  ( ) support things draw conclusions
first  elections legitimate  institutional means citizens make voices heard
' like representative stands  run support someone closer beliefs
's say aren ' good strategic reasons voting someone doesn ' hew closely beliefs would like  particularly opposition far worse ( like voting third party result elect far right reactionary  )
whole  system designed people vote primaries best represent views vote general lesser two evils parties
's small  important distinction  even strategic considerations come play different points process
fact would great could find willing progressive challengers every blue dog district support enough cash enthusiasm win live liberal nirvana  's likely happen
conservatism  incumbency institutional support extremely powerful forces
able replace bad democrat better one great
effectively keep hope alive spread good word possibility arises  prepared ground victory
ask  committed liberal activist readers  help progressives conservative districts enough money run ads take polls hire staff get progressive message places isn ' heard often
people far open hearing things neighbors smart ass town ( certainly vapid  sophomoric gasbags pass progressives television  )
