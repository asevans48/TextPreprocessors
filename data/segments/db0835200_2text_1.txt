keeps getting questions 's going feeding frenzy next week
brewer  's leaving room  time ponder question time doubts arise
fact  're seeing new marist poll says americans feel person transition right track
[ number % ] 's pretty good
nbc/wall street journal poll earlier number like three fourths people responding
person scandal surrounding questions  matter answers  remain unanswered  likely affect people view transition
stoddard  absolutely
next week  christmas week  find one anything wrong  fact alerted feds anything knew 're totally clean  even rod person doubled remains story perhaps 's going go away major distraction person person
however  question people asking person person - - - person doesn ' matter talked number times number times senate seat

find  may legal jeopardy  serious political problem chief staff serious political problem president keeps chief staff
brewer  said question asked

chance rest conversations made public  get decide constitutes `` appropriate `` whether person reported order pass smell test
also tell us whether obama `` known `` speculate endlessly whole thing says `` ability lead  ``

two things stuck exchange
first  brewer brings something 've heard half dozen times msnbc various talking heads  reporters `` taking lot heat `` aggressive enough toward person
taking heat
expected election press would come pressure exactly like
's classic `` work refs `` move
press openly using excuse behavior  new changed rules  seems
haranguing obama failing answer questions  seem think 's fine reveal pressuring reporters harangue
maybe need take questions
concerning thing brewer person seem banking public validating obsession losing faith person
's possible  way assured
inevitable result make press determined find something
come see president sort illegitimate hold public must broken

essential problem give press power run politics  campaigns
