bad news advocates ethanol bio fuels
several recent studies shown alternative fuels actually cause greenhouse gas emissions regular fuels  benefits biofuels come increasing attack recent months  scientists took closer look global environmental cost production
latest studies  published prestigious journal science  likely add controversy
studies first time take detailed  comprehensive look emissions effects huge amount natural land converted cropland globally support biofuels development
destruction natural ecosystems whether rain forest tropics grasslands south america releases greenhouse gases atmosphere burned plowed  also deprives planet natural sponges absorb carbon emissions
cropland also absorbs far less carbon rain forests even scrubland replaces
together two studies offer sweeping conclusions  matter rain forest scrubland cleared  greenhouse gas contribution significant
important  discovered  taken globally  production almost biofuels resulted  directly indirectly  intentionally  new lands cleared  either food fuel
green argument always weakest  bio-fuels  advocates still point fact increasing use reduce dependence foriegn oil
may true cost
contributing depletion rain forest something agree bad thing
rush produce bio fuel without examining true cost environment much less economies world damaging element cost/benefit argument instead crusade greens windfall farmers
person person argued subsidies places small minority among politicians
perhaps 's elected  find way slow process better understanding consequences becomes known
