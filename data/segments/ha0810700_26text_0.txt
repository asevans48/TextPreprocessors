bill person theory hillary person attracts older voters  person person better younger set
person told crowd location suburb person 's supporters inexperienced dealing political rhetoric
short younger voters saps younger  charismatic liar
know  maybe 's forget person 's race
looks like case right message  wrong messenger
last heard bill  singlehandedly worked remind everyone dishonest wife location dash
second quote came unsuccessful attempt manipulate reality four claims terrible danger bosnian uso adventure single  late-night off-hand reference
person told shut trap afterwards
maybe next time  bill waggle finger audience
worked really well numberstill  bill right  say without parsing word
person 's rhetoric doesn ' match reality  see ties lobbyists oil companies loud insistence doesn ' take money either
problem democrats two candidates left race demonstrated penchant lying via ridiculous word parsing  neither bill 's talent getting away
