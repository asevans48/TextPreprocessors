number-number decision  supreme court ruled today unlawful combatants held location location location must access american courts challenge detention
ruling eliminates three attempts bush administration congress establish military tribunals would handle adjudication terrorist cases without involving access civilian justice system  probably derail hearings begun gitmo six members number/number conspiracy
granting unlawful combatants habeas corpus  court eliminated main reason military tribunal system matter  gitmo
detainees access misc courts  may well held american soil
previous two rulings struck tribunals forced government quickly pass laws allowed
supreme court basically ruled constitution applies worldwide rather us residents  makes pretty difficult go back well third time
also  little time remaining bush administration  enough time push third attempt address court 's concerns ruling appears much broader two preceded one
seems absurd apply criminal law unlawful combatants captured hostilities abroad
require person reading
bring soldiers marines captured trial
number-year history  ever allowed kind access enemy combatants captured inside us
update  bear mind yet full opinion  may less egregious heard thus far
however  quote person certainly suggests expansive ruling
squid shark says comments work-around would classify pows done
presents problems
eliminates status unlawful combatant  encourages forces eschew uniforms  legitimate state backing  etc etc
unlawful-combatant designation circumscribed rights location intended penalize hide among civilians attacks
forego
update ii  opinion read
cursory reading  court says congress can not act suspend habeas corpus except suspension clause  requires explicit act noting invasion rebellion
would infiltration suffice  congress even need much reason invoke suspension clause
scalia 's dissent especially scathing  update iii  've read dissents  say 'm struck tone person person
dissent  practically accuse majority deliberately misreading law precedent  especially regarding eisentrager
point dissent case explicitly noted decision gave aliens detention american forces outside sovereign territory habeas rights  yet majority used apply rights case
person scornfully argues court cashiered military tribunal system chance show addressed detainee rights properly
'd say end session couldn ' come quickly enough justices
