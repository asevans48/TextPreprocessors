mr
smith  thank gentlemen
next question person person president carter
mr
ellis  christian science monitor  mr
president  elected number  consumer price index stood numbernumber %
stands number %
perhaps significantly  nation 's broader  underlying inflation rate gone number % number %
part due external factors beyond us control  notably doubling
oil prices organization last year
location location remains vulnerable external shocks  inflation fact controlled
measures would pursue second term
mr
carter  's important put situation perspective
number  so-called oil shock  wherein price opec oil raised extraordinary degree
even worse oil shock number
number  worst recession  deepest penetrating recession since second world war
recession resulted time briefest since second world war
addition  've brought inflation
earlier year  first quarter  severe inflation pressure brought organization price increase
averaged number % first quarter year
second quarter  dropped number %
recent figures  last three months  third quarter year  inflation rate number % - still high  illustrates vividly addition providing enormous number jobs - nine million new jobs last three half years - inflationary threat still urgent us
notice governor person recently mentioned reagan-kemp-roth proposal
running mate  george bush  described voodoo economics  said would result number % inflation rate
business week  democratic publication  said reagan-kemp-roth proposal - quote  think - completely irresponsible would result inflationary pressures would destroy nation
proposals sound carefully considered stimulate jobs  improve industrial complex country  create tools american workers  time would anti-inflationary nature
add nine million new jobs  control inflation  plan future energy policy intact foundation plan years ahead
mr
smith  mr
ellis  follow-up question mr
carter
mr
ellis  yes
mr
president  mentioned creation nine million new jobs
time  unemployment rate still hangs high  inflation rate
wonder  tell us additional policies would pursue second administration order try bring inflation rate
would act leadership tell american people going sacrifice adopt leaner lifestyle time come
mr
carter  yes
demanded american people sacrifice  done well
matter fact  're importing today one-third less oil overseas year ago
've number % reduction since first year office
time  said earlier  added nine million net new jobs period time - record never achieved
also  new energy policy predicated two factors  one conservation  requires sacrifice  one  increase production american energy  going along well - coal year ever american history  oil gas wells drilled year ever history
new economic revitalization program mind  implemented next year  would result tax credits would let business invest new tools new factories create even new jobs - one million next two years
also planned youth employment program would encompass number jobs young people
already passed house  excellent prospect pass senate
mr
smith   question goes governor person
governor person  would like question repeated
mr
ellis  governor person  past four years  consumer price index risen numbernumber % currently number %
perhaps significantly  nation 's broader  underlying rate inflation gone number % number %
part due external factors beyond us control  notably doubling opec oil prices last year  leads ask whether  since location location remains vulnerable external shocks  inflation fact controlled
specifically measures would pursue `
mr
reagan  mr
ellis  think idea spawned country inflation somehow came upon us like plague therefore 's uncontrollable one anything  entirely spurious 's dangerous say people
mr
carter became president  inflation numbernumber %  said
cut two president person person
running numbernumber %
president person also spoken new jobs created
well  always  normal growth country increase population  increase number jobs
' hide fact eight million men women work america today  two million lost jobs last months
mr
carter also promised would use unemployment tool fight inflation
yet  number economic message stated would reduce productivity gross national product increase unemployment order get handle inflation  january  beginning year  number %
since  blamed people inflation  person  blamed federal reserve system  blamed lack productivity american people  accused people living well must share scarcity  must sacrifice get used less
' inflation people living well
inflation government living well
last statement  days ago  speech effect inflation government revenues kept pace government spending
see time running
'll get fast
yes  lick inflation increasing productivity decreasing cost government place balanced budgets  longer grinding printing press money  flooding market government spending takes
economic plan calls
president 's economic plan calls increasing taxes point finally take much money away people balance budget way
poor nation unsound economy follow path
mr
smith  follow-up  mr
ellis
mr
ellis  yes
centered cutting government spending said policies
also said would increase defense spending
specifically  would cut government spending increase defense spending also cut taxes   presumably
federal revenues would shrink
mr
reagan  well
people  think cutting government spending  think terms eliminating necessary programs wiping something  service government supposed perform
believe enough extravagance fat government
matter fact  one secretaries hew mr
carter testified thought $ number billion worth fraud waste welfare medical programs associated
've central accounting
office estimate probably tens billions dollar lost fraud alone  added waste adds even
program gradual reduction government spending based theories  task force working cuts could made
'm confident done reduce inflation location
inflation went national average location returned money people reduced government spending
mr
smith  president carter
mr
carter  governor person 's proposal  reagan-kemp-roth proposal  one highly inflationary ideas ever presented american public
would actually cut government spending least $ number billion order balance budget ridiculous proposal
notice task force working future plans ideas revealed wall street journal week
one ideas repeal minimum wage  several times year  governor person said major cause unemployment minimum wage
heartless kind approach working families country  typical many republican leaders past   think  accentuated governor person
location - 'm surprised governor person brought - three largest tax increases history state administration
doubled state spending governor - number % increase - number % number % increase number employees mr
smith  sorry interrupt  mr
carter

mr
reagan  yes
figures president used location distortion situation  governor location  spending location increased less per capita spending location mr
carter governor location four years
size government increased one-sixth location increased proportion population location
idea tax-cut proposal inflationary  would like ask president inflationary let people keep money spend way like  isn ' inflationary let take money spend way wants
mr
smith  wish question need rhetorical  must 've run time
third question governor person person person
person person  location oregonian  yes
governor person  decline cities hastened continual rise crime  strained race relations  fall quality public education  persistence abnormal poverty rich nation  decline services public
signs seem point toward deterioration could lead establishment permanent underclass cities
specifically  would next four years reverse trend
mr
reagan  talking number congressmen much idea  inner city areas  cooperation local government national government  using tax incentives cooperating private sector  development zones
let local entity  city  declare particular area  based standards percentage people welfare  unemployed  forth  area
tax incentives  induce creation businesses providing jobs forth areas
elements government tax incentives example  business would  period time  increase property tax reflecting development unused property making wouldn ' loss city city isn ' getting tax
would simply delay  hand  many people would given jobs presently wards government wouldn ' hurt give tax incentive
