're going see lot spot polling done first blush debates  's helpful remember two historical points effect
first  's difficult know resonate one debate
first hours person person reagan debate  instance  pundits believed carter won debate sounding presidential reagan specific enough
wasn ' couple days people realized badly reagan beat carter  resonant portions debate go carter taking advice number-year-old daughter
debate didn ' appear offer absolute victory moments either side  like number  probably take days resonant exchanges solidify public mind
person person 's repeated variations person right get lot play  person person 's senator person doesn ' understand
person 's final address probably best moment debate  since came right stump speeches number democratic convention address  's likely surprise many people
may point foreign-policy portion moments resonate person  one expected person beat person foreign policy anyway
person needed keep person foreign policy  ultimately failed fabrications person meeting terrorist-supporting heads state without preconditions  less followed expectations
powerful resonant moment person didn ' even involve
person person  referencing massively expensive bailout plan  asked candidates would cut order pay  person offered freeze discretionary spending  hammered point trying rein government spending entire career
person  hand  offered laundry list spending increases
entire answer  answer anyone find single spending reduction
nothing shopping list democratic spending priorities
person never specified cut would make  even lehrer asked question three times
hit person 's turf
unexpected win person  sticks  could resonant moment needs
otherwise  ' think debate move needle much one way
undecided voters probably stay way third debate  closer election
person needs remain aggressive press obama spending  national security  foreign policy
overnight polling debates essentially meaningless  absent major gaffe
