legislation ' doesn ' solve anything
nationalizes nation 's financial industry
rewards individuals responsible crisis first place - - borrowers business getting loans lenders enabled
repeat - - doesn ' effectively deal underlying issue causing mess  bad non-performing mortgages
something similar person part plan necessary  quickly
would admittedly deal securitized assets part problem - - so-called toxic assets
important treasury establish market none exists right  frozen mortgage-backed securities clogging world 's economy
financial institutions  already place entity take liquidate troubled banks  fdic
throw public money allow banks made bad decisions go business
problem failing banks deposit related  bad loans bad asset management  fdic deposit insurance expanded cover  cash deposits individuals
would prevent bank runs panic
banks teetering brink collapse

aggressive sub-prime lending  housing market ( prices  etc  )
became artificially inflated
' allow continue  happen
argument foreclosures make things worse
individuals  course
affects main cause current credit freeze  's simply true
market already assuming cash flow ( mortgage-backed securities based ) sub-prime market loans zero  asset value much better
's credit market frozen
setting real `` mark market `` asset cost via foreclosure eventual resale way go
cash-flow non-performing assets cease  course  've said 's already factored
knowing treasury authorized  funded  standing mortgage-backed securities `` buyer last resort ``   start credit flowing
support re-stabilization credit market rest us  fed willing pump substantial cash market  already
specificity 's currently table solutions crisis would nice
neither  general public  seen yet - frightening part whole entire process
're trusting people created mess first place - congress - get us
anyone feel secure
thank god conservatives house
