fact  hardly ever feel emotional primaries
's conservatives ( chickenshit dems  neither candidates ) really get blood boiling
primary actually good thing fall
hand wringing strikes typical democratic nervous nellie-ism
huge increase democratic voter registration  building strong ground operations states  new technologies beta tested  lots media coverage battle testing nominee benefit nominee fall
meanwhile  democrats stay center stage person wanders around obscurity  failing raise money leaving trail gaffes wake
long ' know aim fire republicans ' cement narrative
end  remain convinced going election fundamentally seismic either win  even closely might want  due breakthrough nature campaigns
primary continuing going change
' think people realize democratization internet brought system also one main reasons campaign goes
think superdelegates undemocratic  back bad old days ( couple cycles ago ) big party donors pulled strings pulling money decided someone chance win
today  candidacies basis avid small donor supporters contributing online 's prolonged things past point would past
thousands person supporters keep sending money - - ten million since last night  apparently
' like fact campaign continues  blame internet
wouldn ' happened old paradigm
's going win
like people  expect person  see idea unity ticket might begin look like way superdelegates settle
' think campaign hurting - - - person 's getting needed experience learning counter punch
( 's also pin pointing places needs improve campaign fall  )
fact person still winning big primaries getting campaign contributions makes ridiculous expect - - - politician - - - quit ( matter ny times editorial board says  )
legitimate constituency ( nearly half voters ) party wants see
somerby says response person person 's typically daft ( equal opportunity insulting ) column morning  year 's campaign shown happen party two closely-matched candidates
potential downsides party  anyone see
journos like person think 's role demand person hate quit
million-plus democrats [ voted yesterday ] ' exist person 's world
person 's world  person wants person quit
laws childish dreams  democrats must want
since ' think democratic party crumble stress finishing primaries ( even brokered convention matter ) person officially wraps number delegates superdelegates go magic number  think right continue
finally  yes  'm personally looking forward end tedious campaign
'm sure isn ' anyone blogosphere doesn ' feel way
set fight republicans   taking toll communities ( sanity  )
know  's tough
politics  politics unpredictable
blogosphere survive party
update  taste harsh attack ads really look like  check republicans running location location  one  done person person person person fame likely become web hit  would think 'll see sort thing
st person written one patented sanctimonious letters saying doesn ' approve awful ads
's upset wants take
( isn ' awesome  )
sadly  told
's really bad presumptive head republican party really ' control terrible people
c ' est la vie !
least know st
person stands issue heart totally right place
nice scam  ' think
wonder get away way november
