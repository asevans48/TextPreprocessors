saturday night movies  double featurea tonic summer blockbusters  two films without gunsby dennis hartleyas gird loins organization 's seasonal onslaught loud  overproduced generally chuckleheaded summer fare  thought would take moment week catch breath take peek two decidedly offbeat alternatives-one film currently limited release  another caught seattle international film festival
first  new film writer-director harmony korine called mister lonely ( currently select cities  also available right via person theaters ppv service )
straight admit upfront korine  member love hate film school  one favorite directors
followed weekly post  know pretty high tolerance lot folks might call weird even unwatchable cinema  found korine 's gummo ( number ) person person ( number )  well  weird ( virtually ) unwatchable
however  heard good buzz latest ( ok  fact option ordering opposed dragging lazy ass theater may hand decision )
turns korine make watchable film-in form tragicomic rumination alienation  mental illness  tendency humans kowtow alter pop culture  erm  god equal fervor
beautifully shot dp person person ( code number  road location )  film begins elegiac slow-mo sequence reminiscent opening credits blue velvet
choreographed person person 's plaintive ballad mr
lonely  person person impersonator ( person person )  replete requisite red jacket  shades surgical mask  rides scooter  stuffed  winged monkey toy tow
's remarkable scene manages convey blissful innocence aching sadness time
otherwise shy awkward young man puts hat performs requisite flamboyant mj dance moves streets paris  largely ignored ; supplements meager income help agent gets odd booking
performing nursing home  meets person person impersonator ( person person )
two immediate attraction  although person quick mention husband  person person impersonator ( person person )
charlie live communal farm scotland daughter person temple dozen celebrity impersonators ; talks person joining odd welcoming community ( one us !
one us !
chant freaks enter mind  )
first glance  extended family fringe dwellers appears lead utopian existence
barn ( yes  one point  put show )
cheerfully tend livestock enjoy warm communal mealtimes together ( usually full costume )  upon closer examination  seems trouble paradise
sadomasochistic undercurrent runs person organization organization marriage ; one point  tearful person blurts film 's best line  sometimes  look  seem like person person person chaplain
pope ( person person ) alcoholic
abe lincoln ( person strange ) impulse utilize fuck every sentence
buckwheat impersonator unhealthy obsession chickensand
korine throws somewhat weaker second narrative concerning missionary priest/pilot ( misc director person person  can not act ) posse er  flying nuns ( ' ask ) relief work jungles central location
say
luna organization give lovely touching performances ; major reason see film
'm going pretend completely grasped korine 's intent ; film visually engaging  emotionally resonant  haunt afterwards
find easier contextualize pointing two person person films strongly suspect major influence korine  performance ( number ) insignificance ( number )
performance ( written co-directed person person )  narrative plays concept two self-loathing protagonists swap identities attempt escape ; essence impersonating
' think 's coincidence korine cast two principal actors performance film-james fox person person ( plays queen england impersonator )
location 's insignificance  screenwriter person person fantasizes person person  person person  senator person person person person interacting hotel room numbers ; result strange compelling treatise fame  politics nuclear paranoia
korine uses device ( unlikely juxtaposition iconic figures ) expound themes well
granted  mister lonely tastes  would prefer mess person summer  thank much  one possible alternative
currently immersed number seattle international film festival  kicked may number
well  person  considering pesky number-number gig  doesn ' give spare time ( energy ) would need catch number films june number ( 'll year 's siff  beginning next week )
going wait next week begin reviewing festival films  since cozies nicely week 's theme  thought 'd give sneak preview black comedy location hope find us distributor near future
quebecois writer-director person person 's continental  film without guns breathes new life old network narrative trick ( device associated work person person  around least since number 's grand hotel  )
fact  lefleur uses hotel rendezvous point story four lonely disenfranchised people  whose lives destined intersect  directly tangentially
enigmatic opening scene  middle aged insurance salesman snoozes bus stop wakes end line ( literally and/or figuratively )
calmly gathers briefcase coat  appears moment zen  meditating night sounds forest  walks straight darkness trees disappears
remainder film delves ripple effect man 's disappearance lives four people-his number-ish wife ( marie-ginette guay )  number-ish life insurance salesman hired replace ( real person )  number-ish owner second-hand store ( person person ) number-something hotel receptionist ( person person )
sure  age spread characters indicates convenient symmetry  person examining certain universal truths human condition transcend age and/or gender ; namely  fear dying  perhaps terrifying - fear dying alone
say bergman-esque  excuse go hang closet fest
lefleur injects enough deadpan humor script diffuse inherently depressing nature themes
members cast give uniformly excellent performances
almost painterly photography ( dp person person ) richly person atmospheric  small feat film largely comprised static interior shots
lefleur exhibits style quite similar fellow misc filmmaker person person ( adjustor  exotica  sweet hereafter )
like person  person afraid hold shot long needs  afraid silence
silence speak volumes  especially hands skilled director ( watch person ozu film master class )
movie season explosions screeching tires  little silence golden
