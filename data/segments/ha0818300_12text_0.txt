reason believe true  aside fact ( ) organization officials already captured inside location  ( organization ) members person army admitted training organization  ( c ) per petraeus 's testimony congress  location trying build misc version organization  ( d ) according military sources quoted last month nyt  organization 's training shiite militiamen location
yeah  actually  two authors ap piece  person person person person  also wrote excellent  prescient ap story march number rogue groups led former person aide person person splintering mahdi army
proved right case  point petraeus blamed khazali network month later murder five american soldiers infamous raid location
know 're talking  words  ap quote sparingly
would fine time revisit hr
person said badly one kid believe location 's hip-deep sectarian warfare inside location
obvious question  sadrist lawmakers dropping dime organization
presumably 's jam 's main beneficiary location 's largesse ; exposing organization 's influence inside country brings heat guys
guess either two sources disgruntled whatever reason  fact 's sadrists ' rivals isci ( aka
person ) really benefiting organization 's presence  sadrist leadership isn ' chummy location used
remember  one big subplots trying manage shiite militias figuring self-proclaimed sadrist fighters actually answer location versus ones answer location merely use sadr brand commands respect shiite nationalists
sadr sufficiently concerned made announcement recently advising iraqis trust anyone calling mahdi army fighter unless 's part special elite unit person 's busy putting together
sources may working end  exposing special groups operate make harder operate create headaches sadrist leadership
tells lot militias stand right vis-a-vis misc public opinion
morsels article  since ' quote  organization keeps footprint inside location light  never numbering number instructors time ; organization leader person person spends several hours day dealing matters related location  according misc newspaper editor 's organization group ; organization  supposedly  planned supervised location raid carried khazali network  would answer part lingering questions operation  shiite militia attack  seemed unusually professional ( attackers spoke english  american military uniforms  etc  )
