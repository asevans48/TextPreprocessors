according bollywood  location 's film industry  apparently common hollywood clever twist name  person person reports person wore shirt despite deaths family members members organization organization

interestingly  george bush much higher approval rating location us
forty-five percent approve job performance  number % disapprove
'd bet number rises wake location people location sense film industry realize real terrorists leader managed keep nation safe since number/number
part success comes recognizing real terrorists  ignoring pop-culture twits take cheap shots safe targets sidelines
