european union team experts calculated outisde chance location could made enough highly enriched uranium capability build nuclear bomb end year  part project improve control nuclear materials  european commission joint research centre ( jrc ) ispra  italy set detailed simulation centrifuges currently used location location nuclear facility enrich uranium
results look nothing like reached us intelligence community
one scenario  jrc scientists assumed centrifuges location operating number percent efficiency
case  location could already number kilograms highly enriched uranium necessary atomic device end year
another scenario assumed much lower efficiency - - number percent
even  location would produced enough uranium end number
purposes simulation  jrc modelled centrifuges individually hooked together form kind cascade necessary enrich uranium
number variables taken account  including assumption experts location isn ' even close operating centrifuges number percent efficiency
known  however  iranians operating number cascades  made number centrifuges
misc president person person said last april country number centrifuges operation
time  western observers discounted claim mere propaganda
international atomic energy agency confirmed person 's assertion november
interesting story couple levels
first  shows people world still taking misc threat seriously despite democrats liberalsin country given iranians clean bill health nuclear program
second  organization study force rest world get busy third round sanctions languishing moment due objections south africa want wait international organization organization organization ( organization ) head person person 's next report misc cooperation ( due weekend ) well `` personal diplomacy `` iranians run current course
finally  pointed western experts know misc nuclear program today  centrifuges operating much closer number % efficiency number %
also  evidence - yet - iranians enriching uranium beyond number % threshold civilian use
one would think would difficult hide production uranium iaea sniffing around person regular basis
traces would virtually impossible cover
say iranians couldn ' enrich stockpile uranium another location  would difficult carry since organization keeping track much uranium enriched centrifuges
problem come person gives misc program clean bill health iaea cuts back monitoring inspections
danger point given location 's steady progress setting centrifuge cascades  possibility could enrich uranium number % level necessary build bomb without anyone knowing itrises substantially
location may angered one best friends test icbmearly thismonth
location indicated sign new round sanctions actually expressed concern misc program  location 's ballistic missile tests last week sparked unusually harsh criticism location
according organization  misc officials said tests raised suspicion true aim [ location 's ] nuclear programme
remarkable coming location  latest sign potentially significant shift location 's stance location
number  location main obstacle unsc efforts tighten thumb screws location  preferring bilateral diplomacy tehran international sanctions route
january  however  location finally agreed third sanctions resolution
moscow also opposes efforts location location delay resolution
since location expected grudgingly abstain sanctions vote  everything seems track another round punitive measures regime
