paterson also said heard governor tuesday
governor called yesterday  said didnt resign number reasons  didnt go reasons  thats last ive heard  said
asked whether preparations transition underway  lieutenant governor said  one talked resignation one talked transition
location location political world total limbo right
person already facing threat impeachment republican state leader multiple calls resignation new york papers
reports 's using escort service least six months
chance survive remote indeed  obviously
talk floating around today person holding somehow make resignation part plea deal explanation makes sense right
