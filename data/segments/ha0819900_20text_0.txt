could number presidential race come house representatives
abc news thinks 's possible   result could neither person person person person wins white house
instead  speaker house could ascend presidency  assuming senate also deadlocks choice vp
absurd
yes
would take number historical firsts happen
electoral college would produce first non-decision two-party era  throwing election congress
house would conduct vote presidency  senate vp  vote would go state delegations  individual votes members
chambers deadlock remain expiration george bush 's term  person person becomes president temporarily  number election produced electoral tie four-way race  person person eventually prevailed person person ( fortunately ) number ballots
advent two-party system made electoral college ties much less likely  however
even election resulted number-number tie  democrats control enough state legislatures guarantee victory house vote
even house ground tie  matter would remain open resolved next election
person might become president  house resolved election senate produced vice president serve acting president
perhaps specter president person would spur chambers make selection alternative
