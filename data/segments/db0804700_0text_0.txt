saturday night moviesblues ceausescuby person person great film came four years ago called person full gracethe story simple  straightforward narrative young  pregnant columbian woman hires us-bound drug mule desperate bid escape bleak  poverty-ridden existence
wasn ' horror film
didn ' scream tension suspense ahead !
ominous musical cues
quietly observant presented almost detached  life-as-it-happens nonchalance
yet one harrowing suspenseful nail-biters ever squirmed way movie theater
however  finally let breath end person person 's new film  number months  number weeks number days  realized person met match
person wrote directed stark  gritty drama  set toward end person 's oppressive regime ( late numbers )
otilia ( anamaria marinca ) gabita ( person person ) friends share bucharest university dorm
get-go  see two aren ' exactly pair typically care-free  happy-go-lucky coeds
fact  none students wandering hallways seem quick smile ; vibe palpable sense lowered expectations future innate mistrust others tends fester totalitarian police state ( know-that nagging sense dread thinking americans experienced since junior deep-sixed habeas corpus )
gabita problem
's pregnant  wishes abortion
even though story set scant number years ago  gabita might well wished world peace million dollar swiss bank account
number  ceauescu ostensibly decreed abortion crime state location  making exceptions women age number  already mothered requisite number children ; also imposed steep tax penalty  garnished income childless woman man age number  single married ( real piece work )
otilia agrees help
secures hotel room  makes arrangements shady abortionist  bebe ( vlad ivanov )
gabita  otilia person person  increasingly nightmarish heart-pounding scenario proceeds unfold remaining three-quarters film
dramatically gripping moments take place hotel room  particularly hard-to-watch scene creepy bebe forces utterly reprehensible act extortion two young women prior performing abortion
squeamish  may make way portion film
unblinking realism person 's vision demands full commitment part viewer  sensitive souls may want avoid film altogether
think important point apply term person  ' want interpret mean exploitative ; nothing exploitative sexy going
one films find thinking long credits roll ; significance certain scenes doesn ' sink completely time digest
one scene otilia abandon gabita hotel room crucial post-procedure monitoring period promised boyfriend adi ( person person ) would join dinner parent 's house ( boyfriend already asking many questions mysterious errand )
static shot dinner table must last good number-number minutes  otilia sits center frame  able explain real reason eating ( point  audience lost appetite  viewing happened hotel room )
says little  perfunctory pleasantries  dinner guests laugh prattle mundane matters  proposing endless toasts heaping second portions onto plates ( stuffy guests dismiss otilia 's behavior table passive-aggressive inferences must something lower-class upbringing )
nary word dialogue utter several pages script  actress anamaria marinca nonetheless holds rapt attention duration ; facial expressions flagging inner turmoil concern gabita back hotel
's amazing piece acting inspired gamble person pays spades
like fact person doesn ' prosthelytize one way issue abortion film ; merely presented incidental element bigger story  feels live mortal fear one 's government
's little brush strokes end producing incisive portrait oppressed society
instance  relatively simple act booking hotel room essentially becomes white-knuckled interrogation scene ; officiously bureaucratic hotel clerk eyes otilia suspiciously demands know roommate would need room already live dorm
everyone seems infused chronic  low-grade paranoia
single vlad ivanov 's performance bebe
's effectively convincing quietly menacing  repugnant thoroughly believable heavy easy overlook fact quite turn actor 's part must commended
number months  number weeks number days may walk park  worthwhile number hour  number minutes discerning viewer-and depending degree cynicism state affairs past number years-can also viewed cautionary tale
