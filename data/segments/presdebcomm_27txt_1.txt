advocate pardon - draft evaders
think 's accurate say uh - two years ago mr
nixon - mr
ford put uh amnesty three times many deserters uh - excused - uh - ones evaded draft
think time heal country vietnam war think people concerned - uh pardon amnesty uh - evaded draft  - whether crime system - fair
've got - sharp distinction drawn white collar crime - - - big shots rich  influential uh seldom go jail ; poor - uh influence - uh quite often ones punished
- whole uh subject crime one concerns people much  believe fairness - - uh - - major problem addresses - leader something hasn ' addressed adequately - administration
- hope complete uh responsibility shoulders help bring - fair uh - criminal justice system also - bring uh - end - divise - divisiveness occurred country uh result vietnam war
mr
newman  mr
person
mr
person  governor carter  promised sweeping overhaul federal government  including reduction number government agencies - say would go two hundred nineteen hundred
sounds  indeed  like deep cut federal government
isn ' fact 're really talking fewer federal employees less government spending  rather talking reshaping federal government  making smaller
mr
carter  well  've  mr
person  governor location
took aver uh bureaucratic mess  like location  three hundred agencies  departments  bureaus  commissions - uh uh - fully budgeted   responsibility carry conflict
cut three hundred - uh agencies forth substantially
eliminated two hundred seventy-eight
set simple structure government could administrated fairly - tremendous success
hasn ' undone since
resulted also ability reshape court system  prison system  education system  mental health programs - clear assignment responsibility - authority also uh people understanding control government
intend thing 'm elected president
get location  coming outsider  one major responsibilities - shoulder complete reorganization - executive branch government
uh - greatly expanded white house staff
mr
nixon went office  instance  three half million dollar spent - white house staff
escalated sixteen half million dollar  last uh republican administration
needs changed
need put responsibilities back cabinet members
also need great reduction agencies programs
instance  uh - health area three hundred two different programs administered eleven major departments agencies  sixty advisory commissions responsible
medicaid 's one agency ; medicare different one
- check quality health care different one
none uh responsible health care
makes almost impossible us good health program
uh - advocated uh - past week consolidation responsibilities energy
country comprehensive energy program policy
twenty different agencies federal government responsible production  regulation  uh - information energy  conservation energy  spread government
- gross waste money  tough  competent management government  giving us simple efficient purposeful manageable government would great step forward 'm elected - intend - 's gon na done
mr
gannon  well  'd like - press question number federal employees - whether would really plan reduce overall - uh number  - merely put different departments relabel
uh - energy plan  consolidate number - agencies one  would  uh really change overall
mr
carter  ' say sure would fewer federal employees go office come
took three years completely reorganize location government
last year office uh - budget - actually less year  uh showed great uh improvement
also  - number percent increase number employees last year
tremendous shift administrative jobs delivery services
instance  uh - completely revised prison system
established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers
shifted people administrative jobs field deliver better services
thing done uh - federal government level
- accomplished - substantial reductions employees departments
instance  transportation department uh uh - cut back number percent total number employees
giving people better mental health care  increased number employees
efficiency  simplicity  uh ability people understand government control - uh - substantial benefit derived complete reorganization
uh - got federal government level
'  bureaucratic mess going continue
's way people understand government
's way get answer question
come location try - governor - try begin new program people  like uh treatment drug addicts  found thirteen different federal agencies go  manage uh drug treatment program
location government one agency responsible drug treatment
kind change would made
uh - would - tremendous benefit long-range planning  tight budgeting  uh saving taxpayers ' money  making government efficient  cutting bureaucratic waste  clear delineation authority responsibility employees  giving people better chance understand control government
mr
newman  president person
mr
ford  think record show  mr
person  uh - bureau census - checked yesterday - indicates uh - four years uh - governor person governor state location  uh - expenditures government went number percent uh - employees government location term office went number percent ; figures also show uh  uh - bonded indebtedness state location governorship went number percent
interesting testimony given governor carter 's successor  governor busby  senate committee uh - months ago found medicaid program came office following governor carter
testified  words - present governor location - says found medicaid program location shambles
let talk 've done white house far federal employees concerned first order issued became president cut eliminate prospective forty-thousand increase federal employees scheduled predecessor
term 've president - two years - reduced federal employment eleven thousand
white house staff  became president  roughly five hundred forty employees
four hundred eighty-five employees  've made rather significant reduction number employees white house staff working president
think record cutting back employees  plus failure part governor 's programs actually save employment location  shows better plan
mr
newman  mrs
drew
ms
drew  mr
president  location  republican convention  announced would emphasize five new areas ; among jobs housing health improved recreational facilities americans
also added crime
also mentioned education
two years 've telling us couldn ' much areas couldn ' afford ; fact $ number billion deficit
rebuttal governor carter little bit earlier  said surplus next years thought turned back people form tax relief
going pay new initiatives areas announced vail going stress
mr
ford  well  uh - last two years  indicated  tough time
faced uh - heavy inflation  number percent ; faced substantial unemployment
last uh - twenty-four months 've turned economy around 've brought inflation number percent  reduced uh - well  added employment four million last seventeen months point eighty-eight million people working america today - history country
net result going improvement receipts
think 'll decrease disbursements
expect lower deficit fiscal year number
feel improvement economy ; feel receipts fewer disbursements moderate way increase  recommended  next ten years new parks program would cast billion half dollar  doubling national park system
recommended h - housing program reduce payments moderate monthly payments
doesn ' cost far federal treasury concerned
believe uh better job area crime  requires tougher sentencing  mandatory certain prison sentences violate criminal laws
- uh believe uh revise federal criminal code  revised good many years
doesn ' cost money
believe uhh - something effectively moderate increase money drug abuse program
feel uh - education slight increase - major increase
's understanding governor carter indicated uh - approves $ number billion uh - expenditure federal government far education concerned
present time 're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollar
' know money would come
look quality-of-life programs - jobs  health  education  crime  recreation - feel move forward healthier economy  absorb small necessary cost required
ms
drew  sir  next years would try reduce deficit  would spend money far programs outlined  would  said earlier  return whatever surplus got people form tax relief
mr
ford  feel uh - programs recommended  additional $ number billion tax cut  moderate increases quality-of-life area  still balanced budget submit congress january number
won ' wait one year two years longer  governor carter uh - indicates
economy improves  improving  gross national product year average number percent increase last year
lower rate inflation uh - calendar year year - something slightly number percent
employment  revenues
'll keep lid programs hold little extra money spend quality-of-life programs think needed necessary
can not  would  endorse kind program uh - governor carter recommends
endorses democratic uh - platform  read  calls approximately sixty additional programs
estimate programs would add hundred billion dollar minimum probably two hundred billion dollar - uhh maximum year federal budget
programs can not afford give tax relief
feel hold line restrain federal spending  give tax reduction still balanced budget number
mr
newman  governor carter
mr
carter  well  mr
ford takes uh - attitude republicans always take
last three months election  're always programs always fight three-and-one-half years
uh - remember uh - person person uh - jobs people
remember person person social security uh - later president person  sixteen years ago  telling public person person 's proposals would bankrupt country would double cost
best thing look record uh - mr
ford 's administration mr
nixon 's
uh - last year $ number billion deficit - largest deficit history country - deficit spending entire eight-year period president person president person
've got five hundred thousand americans jobs today work three months ago since mr
ford 's office two years  've number percent increase unemployment five million people work two half million people work total seven half million
've also got uh - comparison mr
nixon
's got four times size deficits mr
nixon even
uh - talking people work - uh distorted number percent increase cost living last uh - two years  means - women young people go work didn ' want fathers didn ' make enough pay increased cost uh - food uh housing clothing
uh - last uh two years alone hundred twenty billion dollar total deficits president person uh - time 've  last eight years  doubling number bankruptcies small business  've negative growth - national economy measured real dollar
take-home pay worker country actually less number - measured real dollar
kind record 's talk future drastic change conversion part mr
ford last minute one doesn ' go
mr
newman  mr
person
mr
reynolds  governor carter  'd like turn uh - used call energy crisis
yesterday british uh - government commission air pollution  one headed nuclear physicist  recommended expansion nuclear energy delayed location long possible
subject quite controversial among people seems clear difference president use nuclear power plants  say would use last priority
sir  unsafe
mr
carter  well among experiences past  've - 've nuclear engineer  graduate work field
think know - uh capabilities limitations atomic power
energy - uh policy nation one uh yet established administration
think almost every developed nation world energy policy except us
seen uh - federal energy agency established  instance
uh - crisis number supposed temporary agency  uh 's permanent  's enormous  's growing every day
think wall street journal uh reported long ago hundred twelve public relations experts working federal energy agency try justify american people existence
've got - firm way handle energy question
reorganization proposal put forward one uh first step
addition  need - uh realization 've got uh thirty-five years worth oil left whole world
're gon na run oil
mr
nixon made famous uh speech operation independence importing number percent oil
've increased amount number percent
import number percent oil
need shift oil coal
need concentrate research development effort uh coal burning extraction  safer mines  also 's clean burning
need shift strongly toward solar energy strict conservation measures
last resort  continue use atomic power
would certainly uh - cut atomic power altogether
' afford give opportunity later
extent continue use atomic power  would responsible president make sure safety precautions initiated maintained
instance  forgotten ; need reactor core - ground level  entire power plant uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed heavy - heavy vacuum maintained
ought standardized design
ought full-time uh - atomic energy specialist  independent power company control room  full time  twenty-four hours day  shut plant abnormality develops
kinds uh - procedures  along evacuation procedures  adequate insurance  ought initiated
shift oil coal  emphasize research development coal use also solar power  strict conservation measures  yield every time special interest groups uh - put pressure president like uh administration done  use atomic energy last resort strictest possible safety precautions
's best overall energy policy brief time discuss
mr
reynolds  well governor  subject  would require mandatory conservation efforts try conserve fuel
mr
carter  yes  would
things done change rate structure electric power companies
uh - encourage people waste electricity  uh - giving uh - lowest rates biggest users
' anything cut peak load requirements
' adequate requirement insulation homes  efficiency automobiles
whenever uh - automobile manufacturers come forward say ' meet uh - amendments congress put forward  republican administration delayed implementation dates
addition  ought - shift toward use coal  particularly misc regions coal located
lot uh - high quality  low-carbon coal  uh - low-sulfur coal  's employment needed
uh - would - would help great deal
mandatory conservation measures - yes
encouragement president people uh voluntarily conserve - yes
also private sector ought encouraged - bring forward public benefits efficiency
one bank uh - location  fo - instance  gives lower interest loans people adequately insulate homes buy efficient automobiles
major uh - uh - manufacturing companies  like dow chemical  uh - effective efficiency mechanism cut use energy uh - much number percent out-product
kinds things uh - ought done  uh ought encouraged supported  even required uh government  yes
mr
newman  president person
mr
ford  governor person skims serious broad subject
january uh - number submitted congress american people first comprehensive energy program recommended president
called increase production energy location location
called uh - conservation measures would save energy
're going increase domestic oil gas production - - give producers opportunity uh - develop land wells
recommended congress increase production country six hundred million tons year twel - - billion two hundred million tons number
order improve extraction coal ground ; improve utilization coal - make efficient  make cleaner
addition uh - expand research development
program energy independence increased  example  solar energy research $ number million year hundred twenty million dollar year
're going fast experts say
nuclear power increased research development  uh - energy research development agency uh - substantially  insure ener - uh - nuclear power plants safer  efficient  adequate safeguards
think greater oil gas production  coal production  nuclear production  addition energy conservation
mr
newman  mr
person
mr
gannon  mr
president  'd like return moment problem unemployment
vetoed threatened veto number job bills passed uh - development democratic congress - misc congress
yet time government paying  uh - think $ number billion  perhaps $ number billion year unemployment compensation caused high unemployment
think better pay unemployment compensation idle people put work public service jobs
mr
ford  bills vetoed  one additional $ number billion  bill would solved unemployment problems
even proponents admitted four hundred thousand jobs would uh - made available
analysis indicates something magnitude one hundred fifty two hundred thousand jobs would uh - made available
one jobs would 've cost taxpayers $ number thousand
addition  jobs would available right
would materialized nine eighteen months
immediate problem stimulate economy get rid unemployment
done hold lid spending effort reduce rate inflation
proven  think conclusively  reduce rate inflation increase jobs
example  said  added four million jobs last seventeen months
employed eighty-eight million people location  largest number history location location
've added five hundred thousand jobs last two months
inflation quickest way destroy jobs
holding lid federal spending able - good job  affirmative job inflation result added jobs country
think 's uh - also appropriate point tax policies stimulated uhh - added employment throughout country  investment tax credit  tax incentives expansion modernization industrial capacity
's - opinion private sector  five six jobs  permanent jobs  opportunity advancement  better place make-work jobs program recommended congress
mr
person  follow  mr
president  - congress passed three point seven billion dollar appropriation bill would provide money public works jobs program earlier tried kill veto authorization legislation
light fact uh - unemployment rising - past three months - wonder rethought question ; whether would consider uh - allowing program funded  veto money bill
mr
ford  well  bill yet come oval office  position make judgment tonight
extra $ number billion would uh - add deficit would add inflationary pressures  would help destroy jobs private sector - make jobs  jobs really
make-work  temporary jobs - dead end - kind jobs want people
think 's interesting point uh - uh - two years 've president 've vetoed fifty-six bills
congress sustained forty-two vetoes
result  saved $ number billion federal expenditures
congress overriding bills veto  congress added $ number billion federal expenditures federal deficit
governor carter complains deficits uh - uh - administration
yet condemns vetoes made - saved taxpayer $ number billion could saved additional $ number billion
' ways
therefore  seems hold lid   best ability stimulate private economy get jobs jobs - five six economy
mr
newman  governor carter
mr
carter  well  mr
ford doesn ' seem put perspective fact - uh five hundred thousand people work three months ago  two half million people work took office  touches human beings
uh - city uh - location long ago  near  uh - four five thousand people audience - - train trip
said  `` many uh - adults work  ``
thousand raised hands
mr
ford uh - actually fewer people private sector non-farm jobs took office
still talks - uh success
seven point nine percent unemployment terrible tragedy country
says 's learned match unemployment inflation
's right
've got highest inflation 've twenty-five years right  except administration  fifty years ago
've got uh - highest unemployment 've uh - mr
ford 's administration  since great depression
affects human beings  - insensitivity providing people chance work made welfare administration  work administration
hasn ' saved $ number billion vetoes
's uh - net savings $ number billion
cost unemployment compensation  welfare compensation  lost revenues increased $ number billion last two years
- typical attitude really causes havoc people 's lives  's covered saying country naturally got number percent unemployment rate  number percent unemployment rate number percent inflation
's travesty
shows lack leadership
've never president since war states vetoed bills
mr
ford vetoed four times many bills mr
nixon - per year
eleven ' em overridden
one bills overridden - got one vote senate seven votes house  republicans
mr
newman  governor carter
shows breakdown leadership
mr
newman  rules  must stop
mrs
drew
ms
drew  governor carter  'd like come back subject taxes
said want cut taxes middle lower income groups
mr
carter  right
ms
drew  unless 're willing things reduce itemized deductions charitable contributions home mortgage payments  interest  taxes  capital gains  ' really raise sufficient revenue provide overall tax cut size
gon na provide tax relief 're talking
mr
carter  uh grossly unbalanced tax system - said earlier  disgrace - ah tax - benefits  number percent ' em go number percent richest people country
number percent - number exact - percent tax benefits go number percent richest people country  've number percent increase payroll deductions since mr
nixon went office eight years ago
mr
ford - advocated since 's office $ number billion reductions corporations  special interest groups   wealthy derive income - labor - investments
's got changed
things done  deferral system multinational corporations invest overseas - make million dollar profits overseas - ' pay taxes unless bring money back country
' pay taxes  average misc pays taxes
robs country jobs  instead coming back million dollar creating shoe factory  say new hampshire location  company takes money location - builds shoe factory  ' pay taxes money
another thing system called disc originally designed  proposed mr
nixon  encourage exports
permits company create uh - dummy corporation  export products  pay full amount taxes
costs uh - government uh - $ numbernumber billion year
rich corporations ' pay tax  average american taxpayer pays ' em
another one 's uh - 's important uh - business deductions  uh - jet airplanes  uh - first class travel  fifty-dollar martini lunch
average working person ' - uh - ' take advantage  - wealthier people - uh
uh - another system uhh - dentist invest money say  raising cattle uh - put hundred thousand dollar money  borrow nine hundred thousand dollar - nine hundred mi - thousand dollar - makes million - mark great amount uh - loss uh - procedure
uh - one example  instance  uh - somebody uh - produced pornographic movies
put $ number thousand money got hundred twenty thousand dollar tax savings
well  special kinds programs - robbed average taxpayer benefited powerful  employ lobbyists  cpas lawyers help benefit roughly uh - eight thousand pages tax code
average uh american person '
' hire lobbyist uh unemployment compensation checks
ms
drew  ah - governor  follow answer
uh - order kind tax relief really felt middle lower-income people mr
carter  yes
need  according congressional committees  need $ number billion
listed things - uh - deferral foreign income estimated  would save $ number million
disc  said  numbernumber billion
uh - estimate outside  eliminated tax shelters  number billion
else would raise revenue provide tax relief - would  fact  away business deductions  kinds preferences would away
mr
carter   wouldn ' away - uh business deductions
think would - serious mistake
uh - - could away ones unfair  could lower taxes everyone
would never anything would increase taxes work living  presently required list income
wan na raise taxes  eliminate loopholes
uh - point first statistics gave - - present tax benefits carved long period years - fifty years - sharp tax lawyers lobbyists benefited rich
programs described earlier - tax deferrals overseas  disc  tax shelters  uh - apply people $ number thousand-a-year bracket  think best way approach
's make sure everybody pays taxes income earn make sure take whatever savings higher income levels give lower - middle-income families
mr
newman  president person
mr
ford  governor carter 's answer tonight coincide answer gave interview associated press week ago
interview uh - governor carter indicated uh - would raise taxes medium middle-income brackets higher
uh - take medium middle-income taxpayer - 's $ number thousand per person - uh - governor carter indicated  publicly  interview would increase taxes number percent working people country
think uh - way get tax equity country give tax relief middle-income people income roughly $ number thousand twenty-five thirty thousand dollar
short-changed taken ten million taxpayers tax rolls last eight years  uh - added minimum tax uh - provision make people pay taxes
believe tax equity middle-income taxpayer  increasing personal exemption
mr
carter wants increase taxes roughly half taxpayers country
governor also played little fast loose facts vetoes
records show president roosevelt vetoed average fifty-five bills year
president truman vetoed average  president  thirty-eight bills year
understand governor carter  governor location  vetoed thirty-five forty bills year
average two years twenty-six
process saved uhh - $ number billion
one final comment  uh - governor carter talks tax bills inequities exist present law
must remind democrats controlled congress last twenty-two years wrote tax bills
mr
newman  mr
person
mr
reynolds  suspect uhh - could continue tax argument time
'd like move another area
mr
president  uh everybody seems running location year
'd like raise two coincidental events ask whether think perhaps may bearing attitude throughout country
house ethics committee ended investigation person person  several months many thousands dollar  trying find obtained caused published report congress probably property american people
time
senate select committee standards conduct voted really begin investigation location location senator allegations may receiving corporate funds illegally period years
suppose  sir  events like contribute feeling country maybe 's something wrong location  ' mean executive branch throughout whole government
mr
ford  considerable anti-washington feeling throughout country
think feeling misplaced
last two years  restored integrity white house  've set high standards executive branch government
anti-washington feeling  opinion  ought focused congress location location
example  congress  shortly  spend billion dollar year housekeeping  salaries  expenses like
- next congress probably first billion-dollar congress history location location
' think american people getting money 's worth majority party run congress
addition  see uh - last uh - four years number employees hired congress gone substantial - uh much uh - gross national product  much increase throughout society
congress hiring people droves  cast result gone
' see improvement performance congress present leadership
seems instead anti-washington feeling aimed everybody location  seems focus problem  congress location location  particularly majority congress
spend much money
many employees
's question morality
seems election  focus executive branch corrections come voters vote members house representatives location location senator
's problem hope 'll corrective action taken get new leadership congress location location
mr
reynolds  mr
president  may follow
uh - think 've made plain take dim view uh - majority congress
isn ' quite likely  sir  democratic congress next session  elected president
hasn ' country uh - right ask whether get along congress  whether 'll continued confrontation
mr
ford  well  seems uh - chance - republicans - get majority house representatives
make gains location location senate
different ratios house  well senate  president able uh - work congress
let take side coin  might
supposing - democratic congress last two years 'd uh - governor carter president
effect  said would agree - would disapprove vetoes made  would added significantly expenditures deficit federal government
think would contrary one basic concepts system government - system checks balances
democratic congress today  fortunately 've republican president check excesses vetoes
democratic congress next year  president wants spend additional one hundred billion dollar year  maybe two hundred billion dollar year  programs  judgment  greater deficits spending  dangers inflation
think american people want republican president check excesses come next congress  democratic congress
mr
newman  governor carter
mr
carter  well  's matter uh - republican democrat
's matter leadership leadership
president person worked democratic congress well
even president person  strong leader least  worked democratic congress well
uh - mr
ford vetoed  said earlier  four times many bills per year mr
nixon
mr
ford quite often puts forward program public relations stunt  never tries put congress working congress
think presidents - uh - nixon eisenhower passed number number percent legislation
year mr
ford pass number percent legislative proposals puts forward
government stalemate  've seen almost complete breakdown proper relationship president  represents country  congress  collectively also represent country
've uh - republican presidents 've tried run democratic - uh congress
' think 's uh - congress mr
ford 's opponent ; uh - - insists uh - responsible democratic congress  'm - part  think 's fair responsible nixon administration entirety  part
think  good balance
point  - president ought lead country
mr
ford  far know  except avoiding another watergate  accomplished one single major program country
's constant squabbling president congress  's way country ought run
might go back one thing
mr
ford uh - misquoted ap uh - news story error begin
story reported several times would lower taxes low middle-income families uh - correction delivered white house sure president knows uh - correction  still insists uh - repeating erroneous statement
mr
newman  president person  governor carter  longer enough time two complete sequences questions
six minutes left questions answers
reason drop follow-up questions point candidate still able respond 's answers
uh - extent  gentlemen  please keep remarks brief
mr
person
mr
person  governor carter  one uh - important uh - part government 's economic policy uh - apparatus haven ' talked federal reserve board
'd like ask something 've said uh - believe president ought chairman federal reserve board whose views compatible
based record last years  would say views compatible chairman arthur burns
would seek resignation elected
mr
carter  said president ought chance appoint chairman federal reserve board coterminous uh term ; words  ' em serve four - four years
congress modify supply money modifying income uh tax laws
president modify uh - economic structure country public statements general attitudes budget proposes
federal reserve uh - independent status ought preserved ; think mr
uh - person take typical  erroneous republican attitude number year inflation high
assumed uh - inflation rate excessive demand uh - therefore put effect tight constraint economy  high interest rates  typical also republican administration  uh - tried increase uh - tax uh - payments individuals  cut tax payments corporations
would uh - done opposite
think uh - problem 've addressed increasing productivity  uh - put - put people back work could purchase goods  lower income taxes individuals  perhaps raise  necessary  corporations comparison
uh - mr
burns uh - respect made serious mistake
would wan na destroy - independence uh federal reserve - uh board
think ought cohesive economic policy - least chairman federal reserve board president 's terms uh - letting congress  course  third uh - entity uh - independence subject president 's veto
mr
newman  president person  response
mr
ford  chairman federal reserve board independent
fortunately  democratic well republican administrations
result last uh - two years uh - responsible monetary policy
uh federal reserve board indicated supply money would held four four half seven seven half
done good job integrating money supply uh - fiscal policy uh - executive legislative branches government
would catastrophic chairman federal reserve board became tool political uh - party power
