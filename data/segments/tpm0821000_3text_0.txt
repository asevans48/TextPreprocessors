've done lap coverage big news orgs ad person person put weekend attacking person person canceling visit us army base location
cnn piece  new york times one  location post write-ups  associated press one
stories dutifully note person camp 's push-back ad
single one reports told ad false
person 's ad makes stark assertion reason trip canceled  `` seems organization wouldn ' allow bring cameras  ``
evidence whatsoever supporting assertion
's false
isn ' reason trip canceled
shouldn ' explicitly noted stories
organization record saying informed person camp couldn ' bring campaign staff event
person subsequently canceled trip
even though person camp 's ad false  stories ad focused supposed inconsistencies person campaign 's push-back
person camp 's first statement said canceled trip deciding political  mention organization
second statement said organization told would perceived
reason necessarily inconsistent
person camp could easily decided heard organization trip could perceived political  simply included info organization 's directives first statement
screw-up  certainly doesn ' prove inconsistency
either way  'd think fact person ad contains blatant falsehood would merit mention coverage
reports flag falsehood  'll let know
late update  msnbc gets right
late late update  person unleashes another misleading attack front
