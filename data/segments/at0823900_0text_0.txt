gathering together express support hillary clinton
spent hour morning talking members `` number million voices  `` `` rise hillary rise  `` `` puma `` ( party unity ass )  three hillary 's political support groups
heard mixed messages
hillary 's followers hold three distinct  irreconcilable  views hillary next several hours

hillary supporters  essentially  given democrats
second group made ( one member described ) `` yellow dog democrats  ``
would call `` true blue  ``
going support party nominee
