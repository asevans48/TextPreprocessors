'm certain person campaign wanted ad
either want paint person person extremely liberal want make look unpresidential
unfortunately  folks  try time leave arguments unsupported  ad would much stronger effect person campaign started giving examples person 's extreme voting record
national journal rating used ad nauseam
person vote shows radical nature
let 's talk person minority party voting confirmation person person  one qualified nominees supreme court recent history  belying pretense bipartisanship
get specific
'm convinced folks lying makes person person presidential  either
folks really lying  wouldn ' rational response
without specifics radical voting record  accusation falls flat
use multiple accusations person racism instead
