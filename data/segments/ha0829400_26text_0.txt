yesterday evening  attended mass moment thought would hear actual instruction fundamentals catholic faith
hearing one favorite passages gospels  render unto caesar confrontation jesus pharisees  priest broached subject belongs secular government belongs god context elections choices made voters
unfortunately  wound wasting good opportunity clarify catechism ignore
priest prefaced remarks noting freedom vote  well freedom vote
choice two unacceptable candidates  said  vote either one
defensible argument  one disagree
candidate perfect  worse others
construction  wind governed represented one two candidates  vote would go one less damage
otherwise pretends somehow neither candidate get elected thanks apathy  's irresponsible solution bad situation
homily took better direction began discussing nature freedom
comes creator  founding documents recognize  government  nature individual creation
free moment conception  can not rendered caesar expect remain free
belongs god god alone
vote act otherwise threatens freedom  especially come us
people vote would render unto caesar belongs god
unfortunately  even description slightly specific priest 's
mentioned abortion catholic vote end narn show saturday  complete specific references catechism  one caller planned arguing place doctrine changed tune
instead  said seemed interested instructing catholics point church apparently right
priest didn ' need endorse specific candidates  failed even mention word abortion take teaching moment instruct catholics church 's documents calls foundational doctrine
maybe shouldn ' surprise
last time heard priest mention catechism mass  short pants people still wore sunday clothes church
's wonder catholics believe support abortion still claim vote catholics  politicians protect abortion run catholic candidates office
clergy stops trying pander congregations value inclusiveness truth  lessons never taught
give last night 's homilist credit  though  coming closer priest 've heard decades  missed opportunity real leader flock
update  answer one question comments  'm arguing impose catholic church location arbiter political candidates
'm arguing politicians campaign membership catholic church support abortion stunningly ignorant faith best  hypocrites worst catholics claim support abortion politicians well
catholic priests location could least eliminate first condition honestly teaching congregations church considers doctrine abortion   american catholics continue fall prey pro-abortion hucksters
