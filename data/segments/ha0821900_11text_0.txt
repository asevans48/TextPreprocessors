wasn ' planning blog story otherwise  honestly  look blur looks like photoshop filter
( denial !
snarks deceiver  )
've used paint blur p-shop filters occasion working satirical image couldn ' get look quite right ; filters help soften obscure hard lines indicate stitching
maybe
good enough
right  let 's try another angle
encounter hotel allegedly took place july number
's ap photo edwards taken earlier day location location
compare sideburns distance hair right temple
hmmm
still good enough
well  original enquirer story claims wearing blue dress shirt entered building
's collar shirt new enquirer photo ( fact  smaller photo clearly edwards looks bit like hospital gown )  although guess could changed whatever inexplicable reason got room
still good enough
okay  'd get camera room first place
photo baby couldn ' shot outside window ; curtains closed  're behind
original story say enquirer learned ahead time meeting suggested might even known room numbers advance  's conspicuously mention hidden cameras even though would blockbuster detail
hand  would enquirer really try pass photoshop story hot knowing 'll get massive scrutiny adobe geeks looking debunk
seems clever half
exit question  fauxtography
update  clear  's little doubt edwards hotel
question  photo real cook corroborate story
