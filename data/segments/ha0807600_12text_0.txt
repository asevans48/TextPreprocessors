as-sakina adaptation hebrew shekinah  refers misc tradition god 's presence world  cloud clearly recalls cloud accompanies god 's presence biblical passages exodus number  number

allah 's wisdom transcends human calculation
another point emerges islamic tradition  ' kill children  unless know 're going grow unbelievers
