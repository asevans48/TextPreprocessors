full text speech jump
late update  also argued speech basically sweeping indictment abysmal political discourse
people  order form perfect union
two hundred twenty one years ago  hall still stands across street  group men gathered  simple words  launched americas improbable experiment democracy
farmers scholars ; statesmen patriots traveled across ocean escape tyranny persecution finally made real declaration independence location convention lasted spring number
document produced eventually signed ultimately unfinished
stained nations original sin slavery  question divided colonies brought convention stalemate founders chose allow slave trade continue least twenty years  leave final resolution future generations
course  answer slavery question already embedded within constitution constitution core ideal equal citizenship law ; constitution promised people liberty  justice  union could perfected time
yet words parchment would enough deliver slaves bondage  provide men women every color creed full rights obligations citizens location location
would needed americans successive generations willing part protests struggle  streets courts  civil war civil disobedience always great risk - narrow gap promise ideals reality time
one tasks set forth beginning campaign continue long march came us  march  equal  free  caring prosperous america
chose run presidency moment history believe deeply can not solve challenges time unless solve together unless perfect union understanding may different stories  hold common hopes ; may look may come place  want move direction towards better future children grandchildren
belief comes unyielding faith decency generosity american people
also comes american story
son black man location white woman kansas
raised help white grandfather survived depression serve pattons army world war ii white grandmother worked bomber assembly line location location overseas
ive gone best schools location lived one worlds poorest nations
married black american carries within blood slaves slaveowners inheritance pass two precious daughters
brothers  sisters  nieces  nephews  uncles cousins  every race every hue  scattered across three continents  long live  never forget country earth story even possible
story hasnt made conventional candidate
story seared genetic makeup idea nation sum parts many  truly one
throughout first year campaign  predictions contrary  saw hungry american people message unity
despite temptation view candidacy purely racial lens  won commanding victories states whitest populations country
location location  confederate flag still flies  built powerful coalition african americans white americans
say race issue campaign
various stages campaign  commentators deemed either person black black enough
saw racial tensions bubble surface week location location primary
press scoured every exit poll latest evidence racial polarization  terms white black  black brown well
yet  last couple weeks discussion race campaign taken particularly divisive turn
one end spectrum  weve heard implication candidacy somehow exercise affirmative action ; based solely desire wide-eyed liberals purchase racial reconciliation cheap
end  weve heard former pastor  reverend person person  use incendiary language express views potential widen racial divide  views denigrate greatness goodness nation ; rightly offend white black alike
already condemned  unequivocal terms  statements reverend wright caused controversy
nagging questions remain
know occasionally fierce critic misc domestic foreign policy
course
ever hear make remarks could considered controversial sat church
yes
strongly disagree many political views
absolutely im sure many heard remarks pastors  priests  rabbis strongly disagreed
remarks caused recent firestorm werent simply controversial
werent simply religious leaders effort speak perceived injustice
instead  expressed profoundly distorted view country view sees white racism endemic  elevates wrong america know right america ; view sees conflicts middle east rooted primarily actions stalwart allies like location  instead emanating perverse hateful ideologies radical islam
reverend wrights comments wrong divisive  divisive time need unity ; racially charged time need come together solve set monumental problems two wars  terrorist threat  falling economy  chronic health care crisis potentially devastating climate change ; problems neither black white latino asian  rather problems confront us
given background  politics  professed values ideals  doubt statements condemnation enough
associate reverend wright first place  may ask
join another church
confess knew reverend wright snippets sermons run endless loop television tube  trinity united church christ conformed caricatures peddled commentators  doubt would react much way truth  isnt know man
man met twenty years ago man helped introduce christian faith  man spoke obligations love one another ; care sick lift poor
man served country us marine ; studied lectured finest universities seminaries country  thirty years led church serves community gods work earth housing homeless  ministering needy  providing day care services scholarships prison ministries  reaching suffering hiv/aids
first book  dreams father  described experience first service trinity  people began shout  rise seats clap cry  forceful wind carrying reverends voice rafters
single note hope !
heard something else ; foot cross  inside thousands churches across city  imagined stories ordinary black people merging stories person goliath  moses pharaoh  christians lions den  ezekiels field dry bones
stories survival  freedom  hope person became story  story ; blood spilled blood  tears tears ; black church  bright day  seemed vessel carrying story people future generations larger world
trials triumphs became unique universal  black black ; chronicling journey  stories songs gave us means reclaim memories didnt need feel shame aboutmemories people might study cherish could start rebuild
experience trinity
like predominantly black churches across country  trinity embodies black community entirety doctor welfare mom  model student former gang-banger
like black churches  trinitys services full raucous laughter sometimes bawdy humor
full dancing  clapping  screaming shouting may seem jarring untrained ear
church contains full kindness cruelty  fierce intelligence shocking ignorance  struggles successes  love yes  bitterness bias make black experience location
helps explain  perhaps  relationship reverend wright
imperfect may  like family
strengthened faith  officiated wedding  baptized children
conversations heard talk ethnic group derogatory terms  treat whites interacted anything courtesy respect
contains within contradictions good bad community served diligently many years
disown disown black community
disown white grandmother woman helped raise  woman sacrificed  woman loves much loves anything world  woman confessed fear black men passed street  one occasion uttered racial ethnic stereotypes made cringe
people part
part location  country love
see attempt justify excuse comments simply inexcusable
assure
suppose politically safe thing would move episode hope fades woodwork
dismiss reverend wright crank demagogue  dismissed person person  aftermath recent statements  harboring deep-seated racial bias
race issue believe nation can not afford ignore right
would making mistake reverend wright made offending sermons location location simplify stereotype amplify negative point distorts reality
fact comments made issues surfaced last weeks reflect complexities race country weve never really worked part union yet perfect
walk away  simply retreat respective corners  never able come together solve challenges like health care  education  need find good jobs every american
understanding reality requires reminder arrived point
person person wrote  past isnt dead buried
fact  isnt even past
need recite history racial injustice country
need remind many disparities exist african-american community today directly traced inequalities passed earlier generation suffered brutal legacy slavery person person
segregated schools   inferior schools ; still havent fixed  fifty years brown v board education  inferior education provided   helps explain pervasive achievement gap todays black white students
legalized discrimination - blacks prevented  often violence  owning property  loans granted african-american business owners  black homeowners could access fha mortgages  blacks excluded unions  police force  fire departments person meant black families could amass meaningful wealth bequeath future generations
history helps explain wealth income gap black white  concentrated pockets poverty persists many todays urban rural communities
lack economic opportunity among black men  shame frustration came able provide ones family  contributed erosion black families problem welfare policies many years may worsened
lack basic services many urban black neighborhoods parks kids play  police walking beat  regular garbage pick-up building code enforcement helped create cycle violence  blight neglect continue haunt us
reality reverend wright african-americans generation grew
came age late fifties early sixties  time segregation still law land opportunity systematically constricted
whats remarkable many failed face discrimination  rather many men women overcame odds ; many able make way way like would come
scratched clawed way get piece american dream  many didnt make ultimately defeated  one way another  discrimination
legacy defeat passed future generations young men increasingly young women see standing street corners languishing prisons  without hope prospects future
even blacks make  questions race  racism  continue define worldview fundamental ways
men women reverend wrights generation  memories humiliation doubt fear gone away ; anger bitterness years
anger may get expressed public  front white co-workers white friends
find voice barbershop around kitchen table
times  anger exploited politicians  gin votes along racial lines  make politicians failings
occasionally finds voice church sunday morning  pulpit pews
fact many people surprised hear anger reverend wrights sermons simply reminds us old truism segregated hour american life occurs sunday morning
anger always productive ; indeed  often distracts attention solving real problems ; keeps us squarely facing complicity condition  prevents african-american community forging alliances needs bring real change
anger real ; powerful ; simply wish away  condemn without understanding roots  serves widen chasm misunderstanding exists races
fact  similar anger exists within segments white community
working - middle-class white americans dont feel particularly privileged race
experience immigrant experience far theyre concerned  ones handed anything  theyve built location
theyve worked hard lives  many times see jobs shipped overseas pension dumped lifetime labor
anxious futures  feel dreams slipping away ; era stagnant wages global competition  opportunity comes seen zero sum game  dreams come expense
told bus children school across town ; hear african misc getting advantage landing good job spot good college injustice never committed ; theyre told fears crime urban neighborhoods somehow prejudiced  resentment builds time
like anger within black community  resentments arent always expressed polite company
helped shape political landscape least generation
anger welfare affirmative action helped forge reagan coalition
politicians routinely exploited fears crime electoral ends
talk show hosts conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims racism dismissing legitimate discussions racial injustice inequality mere political correctness reverse racism
black anger often proved counterproductive  white resentments distracted attention real culprits middle class squeeze corporate culture rife inside dealing  questionable accounting practices  short-term greed ; location dominated lobbyists special interests ; economic policies favor many
yet  wish away resentments white americans  label misguided even racist  without recognizing grounded legitimate concerns widens racial divide  blocks path understanding
right
racial stalemate weve stuck years
contrary claims critics  black white  never nave believe get beyond racial divisions single election cycle  single candidacy person particularly candidacy imperfect
asserted firm conviction conviction rooted faith god faith american people working together move beyond old racial wounds  fact choice continue path perfect union
african-american community  path means embracing burdens past without becoming victims past
means continuing insist full measure justice every aspect american life
also means binding particular grievances better health care  better schools  better jobs - larger aspirations americans - - white woman struggling break glass ceiling  white man whose laid  immigrant trying feed family
means taking full responsibility lives demanding fathers  spending time children  reading  teaching may face challenges discrimination lives  must never succumb despair cynicism ; must always believe write destiny
ironically  quintessentially american yes  conservative notion self-help found frequent expression reverend wrights sermons
former pastor often failed understand embarking program self-help also requires belief society change
profound mistake reverend wrights sermons spoke racism society
spoke society static ; progress made ; country country made possible one members run highest office land build coalition white black ; latino asian  rich poor  young old - - still irrevocably bound tragic past
know - - seen person location change
true genius nation
already achieved gives us hope audacity hope must achieve tomorrow
white community  path perfect union means acknowledging ails african-american community exist minds black people ; legacy discrimination - current incidents discrimination  less overt past - real must addressed
words  deeds investing schools communities ; enforcing civil rights laws ensuring fairness criminal justice system ; providing generation ladders opportunity unavailable previous generations
requires americans realize dreams come expense dreams ; investing health  welfare  education black brown white children ultimately help america prosper
end   called nothing  nothing less  worlds great religions demand unto others would unto us
let us brothers keeper  scripture tells us
let us sisters keeper
let us find common stake one another  let politics reflect spirit well
choice country
accept politics breeds division  conflict  cynicism
tackle race spectacle oj trial wake tragedy  aftermath person - fodder nightly news
play reverend wrights sermons every channel  every day talk election  make question campaign whether american people think somehow believe sympathize offensive words
pounce gaffe hillary supporter evidence shes playing race card  speculate whether white men flock person person general election regardless policies
