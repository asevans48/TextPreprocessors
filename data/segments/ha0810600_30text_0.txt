car run fuel produced internal still
instead alcohol  product would hydrogen  creating method would safely allow transition oil-based fuel holy grail renewable resources  hydrogen-fuel cell
would take  according virginia tech scientist  sugar  hydrogen gives efficient burn among potential replacement fuels  creates enormous problems
gasoline relatively safe burns relatively narrow range mixture
hydrogen burns almost mixture  making transport storage highly dangerous
could power homes  cars  sorts transportation hydrogen could get around need transport store
process
instead replace gas stations hydrogen facilities  car would use water-sugar mixture added enzymes catalyst
heated number degrees fahrenheit  would produce chemical reaction producing hydrogen enough quantity power car
car reaches destination  presumably car would device cool still end hydrogen production
person 's process proves successful practical applications  could transform entire energy-independence debate
could also decentralize energy production  allowing homeowners businesses produce energy rather connect central grid rely utility companies  least electricity
depending scale efficiency  could drastically reduce reliance coal oil  extending life hundreds thousands years uses unsuitable new process
certainly could end reliance foreign sources fuel  makes hydrogen powerfully attractive first place
issues might temper enthusiasm person 's discovery
process also releases carbon dioxide  set red flags global-warming alarmists
also might create demand sugar drive cost point makes difficult poorer people buy reaction already seen corn use biofuel production
costs production unspecified enzymes might also problem
however  issues overcome person 's process succeeds  could find end fossil-fuel age much sooner anticipated  successful terms
