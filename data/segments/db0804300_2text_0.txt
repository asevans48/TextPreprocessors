thanks democratic senateby ddaythe senate passed final version piece o ' crap intelligence committee 's fisa bill count number-number
number senators care civil liberties
bill gives amnesty phone companies  gives president great amount leeway spy really whoever wants
dianee person  said would lot trouble voting final bill amendments didn ' pass ( didn ' )  opposed bill  's small victory indeed
's person person  senate passage fisa bill  surprising  extremely disappointing
senate missed golden opportunity pass bill would give intelligence officials tools need go suspected terrorists also safeguarding privacy law-abiding americans
instead senate  help many democrats  yet giving administration sweeping new powers letting hook illegal wiretapping program
hope house colleagues hold stronger line  refuse accept deeply flawed senate bill
calls americans tired rights constitution trampled administration growing louder
congress stand american people  constitution  opposing badly flawed bill
four committees looked bill
three thought needless give amnesty phone companies
organization organization saw necessity  got way
person person called conference call today  `` single largest invasion privacy american history  ``
bill going conference  house 's version quite bit better  though imperfect
sign fdl petition demand house stands behind bill
many house leaders come today spoken defense stripping amnesty bill
today john conyers wrote secret documents provided white house justify amnesty phone companies
'll see means anything
truly perfect crime  president decides break law  employs industry help  's called  enacts state secrets privilege evade oversight congress courts  demands immunity let industry evade responsibility ' defend  restricting peek scope lawbreaking
