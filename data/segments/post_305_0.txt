right  austraila  location  uk universal healthcare
major problem system used countries raises taxes also access healthcare extremely slow
ma probably one lucky ones  healthcare work
one week sick  called dr 's office appointment week
system used location ( personaly know friends location ) would probably take months seen
work emergency room veterans hospital  prime example universal healthcare would work int us
veterans wait least number months see pirmary care provider  consiquently  emergency room run patients would normaly taken care primary care provider
even considering well federal government runs thing
example look wonderful job fema
personaly think would better presure health insurance campanies eg
blue cross  aetna  etc  ensure everyone access health care
also presure pharmacutical companies level prices perscription medications
think actualy spending money saying research  cures cancer comon cold
