one tell issue truly arrived
politicians rush prove authentic
appears happened pork moratorium proposed senator person person ( r-sc )  three senators still running president agreed co-sponsor resolution  tell us
says outcry incumbency protection pork finally made political liability
person person 's credibility issue creates problem person person hillary clinton
democrats used earmarks build political strength
need seen reformers  person 's running explicitly reformer person keep person
mean success
suspect
person person fought pork entire career  still handful republicans policy
hillary person less standing even fewer colleagues looking end pork-barrel politics
co-sponsorship allows look good pork without real risk  coalition democrats republicans almost certainly vote defeat demint 's amendment
still  even happens  sudden need look kosher pork shows issue gained significant traction
first beltway laughed porkbusters  ignored  opposed
eventually  come reckoning corrupting wasteful influence pork
hopefully  demint amendment provide opportunity  looks inevitable one form another
