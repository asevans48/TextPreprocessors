shrill oneby digbyno deali hate say  looking plan leaked  say deal
unless treasury explains  clearly  supposed work  taxpayers pay premium prices lousy assets
posted earlier today  seems likely fair price mortgage-related assets still leave much financial sector trouble
's nothing draft says happens next ; although notice 's nothing plan requiring treasury pay fair market price
plan pay premium prices troubled institutions
hope restoring liquidity magically make problem go away
's thing  historically  financial system rescues involved seizing troubled institutions guaranteeing debts ; government try repackage sell assets
feds took s & ls first  protecting depositors  transferred bad assets organization
swedes took troubled banks  protecting depositors  transferring assets equivalent institutions
treasury plan  person  looks like attempt restore confidence financial system  convince creditors troubled institutions everything 's ok simply buying assets institutions
work prices treasury pays much higher current market prices ;  turn  true either mainly liquidity problem seems doubtful treasury going paying huge premium  effect throwing taxpayers ' money financial world
's quid pro quo nothing gives taxpayers stake upside  nothing ensures money used stabilize system rather reward undeserving
hope 'm wrong
let say  treasury needs explain supposed work try panic congress giving blank check
otherwise  deal
