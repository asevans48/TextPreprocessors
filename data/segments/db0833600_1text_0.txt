gates keeperby digbydavid corn brings curious case person person  readers know 'm fan
points person may believe republican charge may insulate criticism right prepares leave location  lays current objections  've consulted two former pentagon officials -- who critics standard operating procedure pentagon -- who decry move
( neither wanted quoted  might later contention job person administration  )
`` 's probably dumbest thing obama 's done  `` one said
identified three possible pitfalls
first  gates lame duck
indication long stay organization 's top post  seems gates remain quasi-temporary basis
consequently  organization bureaucrats ' want see prerogatives challenged -- if gates wanted thing -- could try wait
second  gates agent change comes organization budget
bush years  regular military budget increased number percent real terms ( counting so-called `` emergency `` supplemental spending bills wars location location ) - - partly hundreds billions dollar cost overruns
campaign  person talked need cut `` billions dollar wasteful spending `` military budget
gates yet demonstrate truly interested reworking organization 's out-of-control budget
keeping gates place sends signal person  faces host hard jobs  eager take organization start presidency  ``
many problems home  `` says one critics  `` person may want anything fundamental organization  ``
finally  gates ' team
many senior jobs organization still held bush/rumsfeld appointees
gates stays job  stay
obama move replace assistant secretaries officials  thus creating something fractured band pentagon gates/rumsfeld people fresh obama people
even gates willing salute new president head new policy direction  holdovers organization might eager follow new set orders
'm surprised person doesn ' want take organization budget
's difficult imagine cutting back government spending point  even wanted
importantly  perhaps  fact military industrial complex one third rails american politics nobody dares attempt even flush easy times
's going kill us one days
two issues worth contemplating  well another one corn doesn ' mention
first  g  ates lame duck something worth worrying bit
bureaucracies freeze anything period time people want wait gates  'm pretty sure
final question even important
gates  accounts  surrounded bunch neocons bush loyalists  holdovers earlier regime
know person decider  's still good idea bunch republicans stake current location strategy `` winning `` place
addition  although 'm sure pleased hear echo bush today statement would `` listen commanders ground  `` military unlikely trust young democrat want test
also question whether trust gates either
one wonders situation keeping republican organization might actually seen military sign fecklessness rather gesture bipartisanship respect
's like bush administration good military
respect gates going back many years  support surge  part location study group report doesn ' make hero eyes
's got long history gop loyalty see reason think habit mind decades suddenly changed
's done 's made political establishment happy important bush administration official kept  validating good judgment supporting bush years
( one guys implicated location contra iraqgate makes sweeter  )
may place holder reasonable period time  giving person space work without ( hopefully ) face brass organization bureaucracy right box  may smart
sooner 's replaced someone start reassure military political establishment republicans aren ' ones capable running organization protecting country  better
's change need
flagwaving  gun toting republicans haven ' exactly covered glory recently
