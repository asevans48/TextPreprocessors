powerline yesterday ; way apology lateness  humbly offer vid
one dumbest things clark kerfuffle many elements military service people respect  narrow critique 's offering person seems almost beside point
see service mainly testament character fortitude ; others see evidence good judgment  others important lesson c-in-c ( ie
experience ) committing men war
far know  person never staked wartime ordeal one  preferring let voters draw whatever find virtuous story
clark  however  acting like basically staked one namely  executive experience  though person 's claiming beatings vietcong somehow turned strategic genius  minimum  romneyesque managerial prodigy
cnn  finally challenged fact person 's military record couldn ' provided much executive experience either yet still felt obliged mention number speech convention
dodges falling back virtues
first comes snippet speech person 's physical courage  sounds like character argument ; person asks amounts executive experience  shifts talking person 's judgment ( per post-war testimony )
executive experience nonsense really straw man cooked focus attention away appealing attributes person happy tout person  garnished lie person wasn ' touting record number evidence superior executive qualification command troops bush
exit question  judgment vis-a-vis location  bring person 's military record
stick  voted war  public says mistake  qed
