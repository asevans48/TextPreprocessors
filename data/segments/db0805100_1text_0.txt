everyone needs part budget solution  including yacht owners  ``

republican party prioritizing interests yacht owners
better expression conservative movement new gilded age
government must limited  welfare must limited  wealthy must get tax breaks wealth must distributed upwards

uh   )
's crucial understand republicans think get away
constituency yacht-owning tax cheats relatively small  constituency people would outraged yacht-owning tax cheats somewhat larger  even supposedly republican districts
main problem  person person notes  political culture location painfully thin
