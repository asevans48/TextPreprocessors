person  bring good points small businesses would benefit
however  rest argument believe false
uhc would benefit majority people
americans health insurance
little confused point single buyer competition
referring insurance companies sellers may understand uhc bill
referring health equipment providers  assume  mistaken would create competition
competition increases buyers sellers
diverse market  competition
competition already big part health equipment providers doctor choose prescribe ( usually recommend generics price )  physical therapist choose wheelchair brand prescribe  etc
qualified healthcare workers selected
paid less  would assume less qualified people would apply jobs
qualified people want get paid 're worth
would hope people would likely see doctor preventative care believe happen
person knows health coverage encourages take care
won ' matter skip appointment  're covered something bad happens
hand  person knows covered pay ridiculous amounts money something bad happens  try prevent happening
overall  believe better solution problem would increase competition eliminating tax benefits bulk purchase health coverage
reducing employer based system increase number buyers people buy individually families
increasing competition insurance companies force reduce spending maximize customer base
aka let 's bring back free market capitalism works best retaining individual rights freedoms
aka capitalism benefits majority people ( 's best hope )
