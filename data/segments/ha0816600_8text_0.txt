remember democrats promised reform congress reduce pork
well  neither person person person person remember  according study done taxpayers common sense
members parties apparently gotten shyness grabbing earmarks  election season focused budgeting nation 's highest priority incumbency protection  yeah  know
's surprised
absolutely one
democratic pork meets republican pork  little baby porks appear grow overnight
senate  person person takes honors whopping $ number million earmarked funds organization bill
person person got almost $ number million
republicans jeff sessions person person follow two democrats pork costing $ number million
house version  number % members house armed services committee earmarked money got campaign contributions recipients
number % receive contributions companies received earmarks  whether member specifically requested
earmarks stand sheer chutzpah  democrats pork chambers armed services committees members
$ numbernumber billion pork senate  almost $ numbernumber billion house
republicans gave ol ' college try  $ numbernumber billion $ number million  respectively
probably reflects disparity membership committees due democratic control congress sort self-control part republicans
energy  republicans essentially given away opportunity demonstrate real difference parties
gop adopted earmark moratorium  could show commitment reforming system regularly feeds corruption
instead  worked hard ensure republicans get seen greedy democrats promised reform number  bellied trough number numberthe gop leadership chambers talked re-establishing credibility reformers
far  looks like talk 'll get number
