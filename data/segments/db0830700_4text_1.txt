revolutionary reported look back
first hear
idea
well  's interesting
obviously  looked number  approached number  motivating republicans important  resources [ ] put persuading independents number
one first things looked number real republican vote real democratic vote  said republicans democrats  independents  really voted  whether voted straight ticket
took look number  took look  last five elections six elections
came analysis graph obviously gave person  showed independents persuadable voters last number years gone number percent electorate number percent electorate number
number percent electorate number  anticipated  number number number  looking forward forecasting  going already decided either us us
obviously fairly well among number number [ percent ]  could lose number number percent win election  fairly revolutionary  everybody time said  `` swing voters  swing voters  swing voters  swing voters  swing voters  ``
graph first strategic imperative began drive would think number  nobody ever approached election 've looked last number years  base motivation important swing  approached
didn ' say  `` base motivation 're going  's 're  ``
said  `` important  shouldn ' putting number percent resources persuasion number percent base motivation  `` basically happening point  - - look graph
look history
look 's happened country
obviously decision influenced everything
influenced targeted mail  targeted phones  targeted media  traveled  travel president vice president certain areas  organization  staff
based  ultimately  thank goodness  right decision
three years later  man saying bill maher  think everybody  including bill clinton  said mistake made first took office governed way far left started republicans took house number moved centrist policy
's numbers went way  's preserved reelection
person person starts way bill person huge problem  think
's good republican party
think person person going govern center majority country
`` serious people `` disease seen discussed ad nauseum foreign policy  asserting politics
essentially conservative villagers wrong nearly time nearly everything  maintain bizarre hold conventional wisdom spite fact consistently full shit
isn ' entirely partisan
many `` serious `` wankers type democratic side  saw location debate
moment clear present danger progressives `` serious `` political types busily setting terms potentially big democratic win victory centrism
're exactly person  going back number years prove  ignoring epic conservative failure past eight
( ask person didn ' use bush 's overreach location person example - - - nobody panel thought bring  )
`` ' ask ' tell `` example always used show president must govern center  hugely unpopular president ran governed explicitly conservative eight years nobody makes connection
's accident  actually believe 's unpopular liberal !
maher comes right back person 's face  comedians bloggers allowed  says 's wrong  country need radical change
's true  would shocked gets
best hope discernible shift left  even precipitate backlash hissy fit among villagers twist democratic establishment pretzels trying prove  forever  aren ' crazed hippie freaks bizarre mainstream agenda
person wants deliver change  first thing figure way either co-opt vanquish village elders
congress wild card
play nice  person may able roll village
decide play `` 's boss `` 'll different scenario
hopefully  learned real lesson clinton years  enable republicans stabbing president back every time tries something even slightly liberal
'm holding breath one
update  person person msnbc issued warning person reassured everyone country democrats likely learned important lesson need ignore crazy morons left ' understand `` process governing  ``
brought number example hippie freaks expecting waay much - - - grover norquist strutting around saying democrats neutered farm animals number election forgotten
bush successfully disappeared
