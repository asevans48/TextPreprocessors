bush legacy watch  location acquires enough uranium single nuclear bomb guest blogger person person  senior national security analyst center misc progress action fund
according data new organization report  location appears acquired enough enriched uranium single crude nuclear bomb bush administratrion 's watch
's back-of-the-envelope math geeks  location possesses estimated number kg low-enriched uranium ( leu ) containing number-number % fissile isotope u-number
uranium enriched level u-number purity suitable use energy reactors
uranium enriched number % u-number ( greater ) considered weapons-grade highly-enriched uranium ( heu )
location could acquire weapons-grade heu enriching existing leu stockpile  contains somewhere roughly number number kg u-number
translates around number number kg weapons-grade heu
organization us doe say number kg weapons-grade heu enough one bomb ; many experts believe threshold much lower  perhaps even half
thus  existing stockpile leu  location well within range sufficient feed one nuke
political milestone technical one evidence suggest location actual bomb highly-enriched uranium needed make one yet
location would still need enrich leu  's good chance organization would eventually notice took place location 's known enrichment facilities
moreover  location would still need make actual warhead develop suitable delivery mechanism
finally  single bomb long way credible arsenal
make mistake  location achieved milestone president person 's watch
