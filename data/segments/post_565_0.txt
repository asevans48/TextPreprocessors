think universal healthcare sounds warm fuzzy lets treat everyone equal whatever  seriously lets think minute
empathize specialist thing
see retinal specialist last year month number months
receptionist warned us bother coming early organization would wait
wait every month fail least number hours even appointment scheduled
retinal specialist
think many poor people plagued diabetes suffering retinal damage number
can not or/ want care diabetes number
able get medical attention
people suddenly blessed universal health care wait would friggin chart
thats diabetic retinopathy
imagine cardiovascular disease  resiratory  mental diseases ; diseases prevalent low income populations aka likely health care coverage
going get doctors  nurses  respiratory therapists  cardiologists  rheumatologists  cna 's  organization 's  like  mention room wards equipment care patients
hospitals number years even little experience say hospitals  although touted near rackets  strapped staff properly functioning equipment
average nursing assignment determined facilities number-number ensure safe care patients
reality nurses assigned upwards number
nursing homes rehab settings upwards number ( work )
seen number
means less care patients involved poor  frankly dangerous everyone involved
health care provider breaks heart see people suffering financial lack insurance whatever  handing everyone country size medical field lacking totally unrealistic
first fix health care system whole invite everyone
also advocate plans like masshealth
many people knock family number year bad
forget statistic huge percent people elligible utilize
