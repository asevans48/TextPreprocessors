sadrists demanded de-baathification commission dissolved  would accept change name
demanded baath party remain dissolved  high-ranking members party forbidden enter new political life serve bureaucrats
sadrists also insisted high-ranking baathists presently employed new misc government must fired !
headlines saying law permits baathists back public life
seems actually demand fired retired pension  employed excluded sensitive ministries
didn ' lot digging understand truth
media decided swallow administration bullshit ( wont since war began  number separate occasions ) week half give mindless defenders another propaganda victory
opposition party standing mute  nobody disputing incorrect myth progress
delay traditional media makes nearly impossible convince public law useless indeed counter-productive
impact administration narrative becomes first market  impossible dislodge
