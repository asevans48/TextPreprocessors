opened federal treasury rich friends  looted like bagdad museum nearly eight long years
's stripped bare point going cost trillions even stabilize thing  village decided 's time sober stop profligate spending
convenient
similar arguments made number years ago establishment decided bill republican malfeasance would come due democratic administration  thus foreclosing possibility solving many long term systemic problems plague ordinary americans
heads win  tails lose
's quite racket
least  hear republicans fiscal responsibility
much ask every time say thing  every opponent gets right face starts yelling bush person catastrophic failure republican governance
suppose
republicans allowed spend country oblivion  reward rich friends hard earned money morph fiscal scolds minute democrats take power  thus denying people sort normal first world safety net
's pattern looks 's highly likely replay unless democrats learn play game
