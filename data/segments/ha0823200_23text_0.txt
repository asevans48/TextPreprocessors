organization launched attack american base location strange twist notion suicide mission
instead presenting attack ambush  simply send waves suicide bombers fortified military position  utterly predictable results
islamist extremists didn ' cause single american casualty  died suicide exchange gunfire  obviously  suicide bombings aren ' exactly news war terror  application little strange
organization mostly fought military using normal engagement tactics ambushes  occasional one-off suicide attacks smaller outposts
usually save suicide attacks undefended civilian targets  fortified military installations constantly prepare scenario
organization may adapted tactics organization  especially aq franchise location died embarrassing death
learned wrong lesson person 's defeat
suicide attacks military positions almost always fail achieve goals  suicide attacks civilians turns local populace
almost seems though death-cult radical extremists become bad death primary perhaps solitary point missions
attack indicate organization banner recruitment year
indicate desperation dislodge nato gotten bad effort seems like success
