mr
carter  maintain position neutrality location location war

think ought least one answer
accused lately secret plan regard hostages
comes answer 've made least number times campaign press  asked ideas would
said  well  yes
think anyone 's seeking position  well people  probably  thought
ideas would think position access information  would know options open
never answered question  however ; second  one says  well  tell  ideas
first  would fearful might say something presently way negotiations  thus expose endanger hostages  sometimes  think ideas might require quiet diplomacy ' say advance  say anyone  're thinking
question difficult answer   situation right  one wants say anything would inadvertently delay  way  return hostages chance 're coming home soon  might cause harm
think done  safely families  tragedy - 've endured humiliation lacking one week year -  think  time us complete investigation diplomatic efforts made beginning  long  came home  order bring - arrangements made
would suggest congress hold investigation
meantime  'm going continue praying 'll carne home
mr
smith  follow question
ms
walters  would like say neither candidate answered specifically question specific policy dealing terrorism  ask governor person different follow-up question
suggested would misc crisis president  would given firmer support shah
location country number million people resisting government regarded dictatorial
question whether person 's regime preferable organization 's  whether location location power right try determine form government country  back unpopular regimes whose major merit friendly location location
mr
reagan  degree unpopularity regime choice total authoritarianism totalitarianism  say  alternative government  makes one wonder whether helpful people
've guilty
someone didn ' meet exactly standards human rights  even though ally  instead trying patiently persuade change ways   number instances  aided revolutionary overthrow results complete totalitarianism  instead  people

second phase misc affair something
adequate warning threat embassy  could done embassies - either strengthen security  remove personnel kidnap takeover took place
mr
smith  governor  'm sorry  must interrupt

third  make sales materiel weapons nation involved terrorist activities
lastly  deal organization unless organization recognizes location 's right exist recognizes un resolution number basis middle east peace
things nation committed  continue commitments
mr
smith  governor person  last word question
mr
reagan  yes
quarrel whatsoever things done  believe high time civilized countries world made plain room worldwide terrorism ; negotiation terrorists kind
last word  would like correct misstatement fact president
never made statement suggested nuclear proliferation nuclear proliferation  trying halt  would major part foreign policy mine
mr
smith  thank gentlemen
first half debate
rules second half quite simple
're complicated explain
second half  panelists follow-up questions
instead  panelists asked question  candidates answered  candidates two opportunities follow
question  rebut  comment opponent 's statement
governor person respond  section  first question person person
mr
stone  governor reagan - arms control  president said single important issue
expressed desire end nuclear arms race location  methods vastly different
suggest scrap salt ii treaty already negotiated  intensify build-up american power induce soviets sign new treaty - one favorable us
president person  hand  says try convince reluctant congress ratify present treaty grounds 's best hope get
can not right
tell us think
mr
reagan  yes
think 'm right believe must consistent foreign policy  strong america  strong economy
build national security  restore margin safety  time try restrain soviet build-up  going forward rapid pace  quite time
salt ii treaty result negotiations mr
carter 's team entered asked soviet union discussion actual reduction nuclear strategic weapons
emissary  think  came home number hours heard definite nyet
taking one location location  went back negotiations terms  mr
carter canceled b-i bomber  delayed mx  delayed trident submarine  delayed cruise missile  shut missile man - three - minuteman missile production line  whatever things might done
location location sat table knowing gone forward unilateral concessions without reciprocation whatsoever
blocked salt ii treaty  mr
carter mr
mondale suggest
blocked senate democratic majority
indeed  senate armed services committee voted number number  seven abstentions  salt ii treaty  declared national security interests location location
besides location  illegal  law land  passed congress  says can not accept treaty equal
equal treaty one reason alone - b-number bombers considered strategic weapons ; backfire bombers
mr
smith  governor  interrupt point
time
question president carter
mr
stone  yes
president person  expressed desire end nuclear arms race location  vastly different methods
governor suggests scrap salt ii treaty negotiated location signed location  intensify build-up american power induce soviets sign new treaty  one favorable us
hand  say try convince reluctant congress ratify present treaty grounds best hope get misc
can not right
tell us think
mr
carter  yes  'd glad
inflation
unemployment  cities important issues  pale insignificance life duties president compared control nuclear weapons
every president served oval office since person person dedicated proposition controlling nuclear weapons
negotiate soviet union balanced  controlled  observable  reducing levels atomic weaponry  disturbing pattern attitude governor person
never supported arms control agreements - limited test ban  salt  antiballistic missile treaty  location treaty negotiated soviet union president person - wants throw wastebasket treaty control nuclear weapons balanced equal basis location location  negotiated seven-year period  two republican predecessors
senate voted yet strategic arms limitation treaty
preliminary skirmishing committees senate  treaty never come floor senate either debate vote
's understandable senator preliminary debates make irresponsible statement   maybe  ill-advised statement
've got number senators correct mistake  mistake
man hopes president says  take treaty  discard  vote  debate  explore issues  finally capitalize long negotiation - dangerous disturbing thing
mr
smith  governor person  opportunity rebut
reagav  yes  'd like respond much
first  soviet union critical previous agreements  's 've out-negotiated quite long time
managed  spite attempts arms limitation  go forward biggest military build-up history man
suggest two republican presidents tried pass salt treaty - puts side - would like say president person  within number % treaty could agreement left office  emphatically salt treaty
would like point also senators like person person person location location - taking lead fight particular treaty
talking scrapping
talking taking treaty back  going back negotiations
would say location location  sit negotiate long takes  legitimate arms limitation  reduction nuclear weapons point neither one us represents threat
hardly throwing away treaty opposed arms limitation
mr
smith  president carter
mr
carter  yes
governor person making misleading disturbing statements
advocates scrapping treaty - ' know men quotes treaty final form - also advocates possibility  said 's missing element  playing trump card soviet union nuclear arms race  insisting upon nuclear superiority nation  predication negotiation future location location
president person said  scrap treaty  negotiated three misc presidents seven-year period time  insist upon nuclear superiority basis future negotiations  believe launching nuclear arms race good basis future negotiations  's obvious  president  americans  would reject proposition
would mean resumption dangerous nuclear arms race
would disturbing american people
would change basic tone commitment nation experienced ever since second world war  al presidents  democratic republican
would also disturbing allies  support nuclear arms treaty
addition  adversarial relationship soviet union would undoubtedly deteriorate rapidly
attitude extremely dangerous belligerent tone  although 's said quiet voice
mr
smith  governor reagan
mr
reagan  know president 's supposed replying  sometimes  hard time connecting 's saying  said positions
sometimes think 's like witch doctor gets mad good doctor comes along cure 'll work
point made already  mr
president  regard negotiating  call nuclear superiority part location location
calls mutual reduction weapons  say  neither us represent threat
suggest salt ii treaty negotiators negotiated continuation  based preceding efforts two previous presidents  true
new negotiation  say  president person within number % solution could acceptable
think allies would happy go along fair verifiable salt agreement
mr
smith  president person  last word question
mr
carter  think  close discussion  would better put perspective 're talking
discussion daughter  person  day  came  ask important issue
said thought nuclear weaponry - control nuclear arms
formidable force
weapons number megatons explosion
put number tons tnt one railroad cars  would carload tnt - trainload tnt stretching across nation
's one major war explosion warhead
thousands  equivalent megaton  million tons  tnt warheads
control weapons single major responsibility president  cast commitment presidents  slight technicalities corrected  dangerous approach
mr
smith  go another question  person person president carter
person person  mr
president  said  americans  conservation  importing much less oil today even year ago
yet us dependence arab oil percentage total imports today much higher time number arab oil embargo  time came  loss substantial amounts arab oil could plunge us depression
means bridge must built dependence
location location develop synthetic fuels alternative energy sources without damage environment  process mean steadily higher fuel bills american families
mr
carter  ' think 's doubt  future  cost oil going go
've basic commitment since 've president reduce dependence foreign oil
done two ways  one  conserve energy - stop waste energy -  secondly  produce american energy
've successful cases
've reduced importing foreign oil last year alone one-third
imported today number million barrels oil less date year ago
commitment opening bright vista nation future  windfall profits tax base  opportunity use american technology misc ability american natural resources expand rapidly production synthetic fuels  yes ; expand rapidly production solar energy  yes ; also produce traditional kinds american energy
drill oil gas wells year year history
'll produce coal year year history
exporting coal year year history
opportunity improved transportation systems improved loading facilities ports  see good opportunity world international market  replace opec oil american coal basic energy source
exciting future give us energy security  also open vast opportunities americans live better life millions new jobs associated new dynamic industry prospect new energy policy 've put effect
mr
smith  would repeat question governor reagan
mr
ellis  governor person  americans  conservation  importing much less oil today even year ago
yet  us reliance arab oil percentage total imports much higher today number arab oil embargo
substantial loss arab oil could plunge location location depression
question whether development alternative energy sources  order reduce dependence  done without damaging environment  mean american families steadily higher fuel bills
mr
reagan  'm sure means steadily higher fuel costs  believe nation portrayed long time people energy-poor energy-rich
coal president mentioned - yes  - yet one-eighth total coal resources utilized right
mines closed ; number miners work
due regulations either interfere mining prevent burning
modern technology  yes  burn coal within limits clean air act
think  technology improves  'll able even better
thing leased - begun explore - number % outer continental shelf oil  believed  everyone familiar fuel source energy  vast supplies yet found
government  last year  taken multiple use millions acres public lands - well  public lands subject multiple use - exploration minerals forth
believed probably number % potential oil location location probably hidden lands  one allowed even go explore find
particularly true recent efforts shut part location
nuclear power  number power plants planned country
let add word safety ; must done utmost safety
number given canceled plans build   government regulations permits  forth  take - make take - twice long build nuclear plant location location build one location western europe
sources
energy rich  coal one great potentials
mr
smith  president person  comment
mr
carter  repeat  year opportunity  'll realize  produce number million tons coal - unequaled record history country
governor person says good achievement  blames restraints coal production regulations - regulations affect life health safety miners  also regulations protect purity air quality water land
can not cast aside regulations
chance next number years  insisting upon health safety workers mines  also preserving high air water pollution standards  triple amount coal produce
governor person 's approach energy policy  already proven effectiveness  repeal  change substantially  windfall profits tax - return major portion $ number billion back oil companies ; away department energy ; short-circuit synthetic fuels program ; put minimal emphasis solar power ; emphasize strongly nuclear power plants major source energy future
wants put eggs one basket give basket major oil companies
mr
smith  governor person
mr
reagan  misstatement  course  position
happen believe free enterprise better job producing things people need government
department energy multi-billion-dollar budget excess $ number billion
hasn ' produced quart oil lump coal  anything else line energy
mr
carter suggest want away safety laws laws pertain clean water clean air  forth
governor location  took charge passing strictest air pollution laws location location - strictest air quality law even adopted location location
created osha - occupational safety health agency - protection employees federal government one place
day  one decisions rulings ever challenged
think charges missing point
suggesting literally thousands unnecessary regulations invade every facet business  indeed  much personal lives  unnecessary ; government without ; added $ number billion cost production country ; contributing part inflation
would like see us little free
mr
smith  president person  another crack
mr
carter  sure
matter fact
air pollution standard laws passed location passed objections governor person  well-known fact
also  recently  someone suggested occupational safety health act abolished  governor person responded  amen
offshore drilling rights question governor person raises often
matter fact  proposal location lands legislation  number % offshore lands would open exploration  number % location lands  suspected believed minerals might exist
five-year plan leasing offshore lands  proposed land drilled opened drilling since program first started number
're putting restraints misc exploration  're encouraging every way
mr
smith  governor person  last word question
mr
reagan  yes
well-known fact opposed air pollution laws location  thing possibly think president must suggesting law federal government tried impose state location - law  regulations - would made impossible drive automobile within city limits location city  place put drive regulations
would destroyed economy location   must say  support congress pointed ridiculous attempt environmental protection agency
still strictest air control  air pollution laws country
offshore oiling  number % leased producing oil
rest  whether lands going opened next five years - 're already five years behind
oil  wells drilled  taken number years 've drilled
mr
smith  thank governor
thank  mr
president
next question goes governor person person person
mr
person  governor person  wage earners country - especially young - supporting social security system continues affect income drastically
system fostering struggle young old  drifting country toward polarization two groups
much longer young wage earner expect bear ever-increasing burden social security system
mr
reagan  social security system based false premise  regard fast number workers would increase fast number retirees would increase
actuarially balance  first became evident number years ago  us voicing warnings
trillions dollar balance  answer come far biggest single tax increase nation 's history - payroll tax increase social security - put band-aid postpone day reckoning years
needed study proposed task force experts look entire problem reformed made actuarially sound  premise one presently dependent social security going rug pulled get check
can not frighten  threats campaign rhetoric gone campaign  senior citizens - leave thinking way  're endangered would place turn
must continue get checks  believe system put sound actuarial basis
's going take study work  passing tax increase let load - roof - fall next administration
mr
smith  would repeat question president carter
mr
person  yes
president person  wage earners country  especially young  supporting social security system continues affect income drastically
system fostering struggle young old drifting country toward polarization two groups
much longer young wage earner expect bear ever-increasing burden social security system
mr
carter  long democratic president white house  strong viable social security system  free threat bankruptcy
although governor person changed position lately  four different occasions  advocated making social security voluntary system  would  effect  quickly bankrupt
noticed also wall street journal early week  preliminary report task force advocates making social security sound reducing adjustment social security retired people compensate impact inflation
kinds approaches dangerous security  well peace mind retired people country approaching retirement age
matter takes future keep social security sound  must kept way
although serious threat social security system integrity number campaign became president  action democratic congress working put social security back sound financial basis
way stay
mr
smith  governor reagan
mr
reagan  well  isn ' true
said  delayed actuarial imbalance falling us years increase taxes  ' believe go increasing tax  problem young people today paying far ever expect get
statement somehow  wanted destroy changed tune  voluntary social security  would mean ruin
mr
president  voluntary thing suggested many years ago young man orphaned raised aunt died  aunt ineligible social security insurance mother
suggested insurance program  certainly person paying able name beneficiary
closest ever come anything voluntary social security
pledged social security program reassure senior citizens going continue get money
changes would like make
would like make change regulation discriminates wife works finds faced choice father 's husband 's benefits  dies first  paid ; recognize also paying  entitled presently get
'd like change
mr
smith  president person 's rebuttal
mr
carter  constant suggestions basic social security system changed call concern consternation among aged country
obvious commitment  social security benefits taxed would peremptory change standards social security payments made retired people
also need continue index social security payments  inflation rises  social security payments would rise commensurate degree let buying power social security check continue intact
past  relationship social security medicare important providing modicum aid senior citizens retention health benefits
governor person  matter fact  began political career campaigning around nation medicare
opportunity move toward national health insurance  emphasis prevention disease  emphasis out-patient care  in-patient care ; emphasis hospital cost containment hold cost hospital care far ill  emphasis catastrophic health insurance  family threatened wiped economically high medical bill  insurance would help pay
kinds elements national health insurance  important american people
governor person   typically proposal
mr
smith  governor
mr
reagan  opposed medicare  another piece legislation meeting problem congress
happened favor piece legislation thought would better senior citizens provide better care one finally passed
opposing principle providing care
opposing one piece legislation versus another
something else social security
course  doesn ' come payroll tax
comes general fund  something done
think disgraceful disability insurance fund social security finds checks going every month tens thousands people locked institutions crime mental illness  receiving disability checks social security every month state institution provides needs care
mr
smith  president person  last word question
mr
carter  think debate social security  medicare  national health insurance typifies  vividly subject tonight  basic historical differences democratic party republican party
allusions basic changes minimum wage another  deleterious comments governor person made unemployment compensation
commitments democratic party historically made working families nation extremely important growth stature better quality life
noticed recently governor person frequently quotes democratic presidents acceptance address
never heard candidate president  republican  quote republican president  get office  try govern like republicans
good fo american people remember sharp basic historical difference governor person crucial issues - also  two parties represent
mr
smith  thank mr
president  governor person
go another question - question president person person waiters
ms
walters  thank
addressed major issues tonight  biggest issue mind misc voters - ability lead country
many voters go booth week today  voting gut instinct men
already given us reasons people vote  would please tell us final question  vote opponent  presidency could harmful nation  examined opponent 's record man  tell us greatest weakness
mr
carter  person  reluctant say anything critical governor person  try answer question
first  historical perspective described
contest democrat mainstream party  exemplified actions taken oval office last four years  contrasted governor person  cases typify party  cases  radical departure heritage eisenhower others
important crucial difference election campaign  judgment  approach control nuclear weaponry inclination control control spread atomic weapons nations ' presently  particularly terrorist nations
inclination governor person exemplified many troubled times since running president - think since number - inject american military forces places like north location  put blockade around location year  instances  project american forces fishing dispute small nation ecuador west coast south america
typical long-standing inclination  use american power  resolve disputes diplomatically peacefully  show exercise military power best proven actual use
obviously  president wants war  certainly believe governor person  president  would want war  president oval office make judgment almost daily basis exercise enormous power country peace  diplomacy  careless way belligerent attitude exemplified attitudes past
mr
smith  person  would repeat question governor reagan
ms
walters  yes  thank
realizing may equally reluctant speak ill opponent  may ask people vote opponent  presidency could harmful nation  examined opponent 's record man  could tell us greatest weakness
mr
reagan  well  person  believe fundamental difference - think evident answers mr
carter given tonight - seeks solution anything another opportunity federal government program
happen believe federal government usurped powers autonomy authority belong back state local level
imposed individual freedoms people  things could solved people  given chance  levels government closer
shouldn '  candidate number  president carter invented thing called misery index
added rate unemployment rate inflation  came  time  numbernumber % president person
said man size misery index right seek reelection presidency
today  decision  misery index excess number %  think must suggest something
quoted democratic president  president says  democrat
said many foolish things back days
president quoted made promise  democratic promise  quoted never kept
today  would find promise heart republicanism represents country today
's believe going millions democrats going vote us time around  want promise kept
promise less government less taxes freedom people
mr
smith  president carter
mr
carter  mentioned radical departure governor person principles ideals historical perspective party
' think better illustrated case guaranteeing women equal rights constitution nation
number years  republican party platforms called guaranteeing women equal rights constitutional amendment
six predecessors mine served oval office called guarantee women 's rights
governor person new republican party departed commitment - severe blow opportunity women finally correct discrimination suffered
man women amount work  man gets paid $ numbernumber  women gets paid number cents
equal rights amendment says equality rights shall abridged omen b federal government state governments
says simple guarantee equality opportunity typifies democratic arty  important commitment mine  contrasted governor person 's radical departure long-standing policy party
mr
smith  governor reagan
mr
reagan  yes
mr
president   happen amendment  think amendment take problem hands elected legislators put hands f unelected judges
equal rights  office four ears one single state - f majority democratic legislators - added ratification r voted ratify equal rights amendment
governor  eight years ago  found number separate instances women discriminated body location law  passed signed law number statutes eliminated discriminations  including economic ones mentioned - equal pay forth
believe years spent trying get amendment  spent much time correcting laws  location - first
president  would also take look hundreds federal regulations discriminate women go right everyone looking amendment
would someone ride herd regulations  would start eliminating discriminations federal government women
mr
smith  president carter
mr
carter  howard  'm southerner  share basic beliefs region excessive government intrusion private affairs american citizens also private affairs free enterprise system
one commitments made deregulate major industries country
've remarkably successful  help democratic congress
deregulated air industry  rail industry  trucking industry  financial institutions
're working communications industry
addition  believe element discrimination something south seen vividly blight region country corrected - racial discrimination discrimination people work living - trying pick bootstraps  since long depression years  lead full useful life affairs country
made remarkable success
part consciousness commitment continue progress
heritage southerner  experience oval office  convinces described proper course future
mr
smith  governor person  last word
mr
reagan  well  last word say  talking simple amendment women 's rights
make plain  women 's rights
would like call attention people fact so-called simple amendment would used mischievous men destroy discriminations properly belong  law  women respecting physical differences two sexes  labor laws protect things would physically harmful
would  could challenged men
would true regard combat service military forth
thought subject supposed
're talking much think working people forth  'm fellow ever ran job six times president union still lifetime membership union
mr
smith  gentlemen  three minutes closing statement
