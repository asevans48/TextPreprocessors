question administration right thing
case  believe programs stimulate creative energies hundred eighty million free americans
believe programs senator person advocates tendency stifle creative energies  believe words  program would lead stagnation motive power need country get progress
final point would like make  senator person suggested speeches lack compassion poor  old  others unfortunate

] first question senator person mr
fleming
mr
fleming  senator  vice president campaign said naive times immature
raised question leadership
issue  think people vote rather vice president
mr
kennedy  well  vice president came congress together number ; served labor committee
've fourteen years  period time  experience uh - government comparable
secondly  think question uh - programs advocate  party record lead
come democratic party  century produced person person person person person person  supported sustained programs 've discussed tonight
mr
nixon comes republican party
nominated
fact last twenty-five years republican leadership opposed federal aid education  medical care aged  development location location  development natural resources
think mr
nixon effective leader party
hope would grant
question us  point view party want lead location location
mr
smith  mr
nixon  would like comment statement
mr
nixon  comment
mr
smith  next question  mr
novins
mr
novins  mr
vice president  campaign stresses value eight year experience  question arises whether experience observer participant initiator policy-making
would tell us please specifically major proposals made last eight years adopted administration
mr
nixon  would rather difficult cover eight - two half minutes
would suggest proposals could mentioned
first  foreign trips made recommendations adopted
example  first trip abroad - abroad  strongly recommended increase exchange programs particularly related exchange persons leaders labor field information field
trip south america  made recommendations separate inter-american lending agency set south american nations would like much better lend - participate lending agencies treated countries world
uh - made recommendations trips ; example  trip abroad location made recommendations regard misc refugee situation adopted  president enacted law congress
within administration  chairman president 's committee price stability economic growth  opportunity make recommendations adopted within administration think reasonably effective
know senator person suggested speech location yesterday committee particularly effective
would suggest take credit - would presume - since committee formed price line held well within location location
mr
kennedy  well  would say latter - 's found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory figures uh - mr
nixon  used previous speech  talked truman administration
- mr
truman came office nineteen uh - forty-four end war  uh - difficulties facing location location period transition - number price controls lifted - 's rather difficult use overall figure taking seven half years comparing last eight years
prefer take overall percentage record last twenty years democrats eight years republicans show overall period growth
regard uh - price stability uh - 'm aware committee produce recommendations ever certainly congress point view legislation regard controlling prices
regard exchange students labor unions  chairman subcommittee africa think one unfortunate phases policy towards country minute number exchanges
think 's true location location also
come forward program students congo three hundred federal government africa previous year  ' think uh - moved least two areas sufficient vigor
mr
smith  next question senator person mr
warren
mr
warren  uh - senator person  brief speech minutes ago mentioned farm surpluses
mr
kennedy  's correct
mr
warren  'd like ask  's fact  think  presidential candidates traditionally make promises farmers
lots people  think  ' understand government pays farmers producing certain crops paying farmers overproduce matter
let ask  sir  ' farmer operate like business man operates factory
auto company overproduces certain model car uncle person doesn ' step buy surplus
constant courting farmer
mr
kennedy  well  think federal government moved program withdrew supports uh - think would complete uh - economic chaos
farmer plants spring harvests fall
hundreds thousands
really ' - 're able control market well
bring crops livestock  many time
purchasers buy milk hogs - large companies many cases - therefore farmer position bargain effectively market place
think experience twenties shown free market could agriculture
agricultural economy collapses  economy rest location location sooner later collapse
farmers number one market automobile industry location location
automobile industry number one market steel
farmers ' economy continues decline sharply recent years  think would recession rest country
think case government intervention good one
secondly  objection present farm policy effective controls bring supply demand better balance
dropping support price order limit production work  highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollar worth
've uh - higher tax load treasury farmer last years lowest farm income many years
think farm policy failed
judgment policy work effective supply demand balance
done governmental action
therefore suggest basic commodities supported  federal government  endorsement farmers commodity  attempt bring supply demand balance - attempt effective production controls - won ' five six per cent surplus breaks price fifteen twenty per cent
think mr
person 's program failed
must say  reading vice president 's speech farmers  read mine  ' believe 's much different mr
person 's
' think provides effective governmental controls
think support prices tied average market price last three years  mr
person 's theory
therefore believe sharp enough breach past give us hope success future
mr
smith  mr
nixon  comment
mr
nixon ; course disagree senator person insofar suggestions done uh - re - farm program
made suggestion need move direction government controls  suggestion would also mean raising prices uh - consumers pay products im - imposing upon farmers uh - controls acreage even far today
think wrong direction
' think worked past ; think work future
program advocated one departs present program respect
recognizes government responsibility get farmer trouble presently government got
's fundamental reason ' let farmer go present time
farmer produced surpluses government asked legislation war
surpluses  's responsibility indemnify farmer period get rid farmer uh - surpluses
get surpluses farmer 's back  however  program announced  see farm income holds
would propose holding income type program senator person suggested would raise prices  one would indemnify farmer  pay farmer kind uh - products surplus
mr
smith  next question vice president person mr
vanocur
mr
vanocur  uh - mr
vice president  since question executive leadership important campaign issue  'd like follow mr
novins ' question
republican campaign slogans - 'll see signs around country last week - say 's experience counts - 's picture ; sir uh - implying 've governmental executive decision-making uh - experience uh - opponent
news conference august twenty-fourth  president person asked give one example major idea adopted
reply  'm quoting ; `` give week might think one
' remember  ``
month ago  sir  president hasn ' brought since  'm wondering  sir  clarify version correct - one put republican campaign leaders one put president eisenhower
mr
nixon  well  would suggest  mr
vanocur  uh - know president  probably facetious remark
uh - would also suggest insofar statement concerned  think would improper president location location disclose uh - instances members official family made recommendations  made years  accepted rejected
president always maintained properly entitled get advice wants cabinet advisers without disclosing anybody - including matter fact congress
say
years sat national security council
cabinet
met legislative leaders
met president made great decisions regard location  location location location  matters
president asked advice
given
sometimes advice taken
sometimes
say made decisions
would say president ever allow anybody else make major decisions  president makes decisions
advisers give counsel asks
far experience counts whether experience counts  isn ' say
uh - say experience people consider ; senator person 's people consider
pointed  came congress year
experience different mine
mine executive branch
legislative branch
would say people opportunity evaluate mine think going abide whatever people decide
mr
smith  senator person
mr
kennedy  well  'll say question experience question also uh - judgment future  goals location location  ability implement goals
person person came presidency number rather little known uh - session house representatives defeated senate fifty-eight distinguished president
's certain road presidency
guarantees uh - take uh - one road another successful president
congress fourteen years
voted last uh - eight years uh - vice president uh - presiding senate meeting responsibilities
met met uh - decisions eight hundred times matters affect domestic security location location  member senate foreign relations committee
question really  candidate party meet problems location location going face sixties
mr
smith  next question senator person mr
novins
mr
novins  senator person  connection problems future speak  program enunciated earlier direct talk  call expanding welfare programs schools  teacher salaries  medical care  forth ; also call reducing federal debt
'm wondering  're president january  would go paying bill
mean
mr
kennedy  didn ' indicate
advocate reducing federal debt ' believe 're going able reduce federal debt much nineteen sixty-one  two  three
think heavy obligations affect security  're going meet
therefore 've never suggested uh - able retire debt substantially  even nineteen sixty-one two
mr
novins  senator  believe - one speeches - mr
kennedy   never
mr
novins  - suggested reducing interest rate would help toward - mr
kennedy
