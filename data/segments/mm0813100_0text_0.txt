* * * ] let 's say  hypothetically  blogger going moving not-too-distant future state city somewhat sane gun laws
let 's say  hypothetically  blogger wanted able keep medium-to-large defensive handgun ready-to-go master bedroom would secure day quickly accessible event trouble
let 's say  hypothetically  blogger also small kids good kids  extremely bright curious  still young trusted around guns
extremely bright mean rhesus-monkey-after-tourist-candy-bars clever ; capable ( eg )
improvising stepladders using keys padlocks
obviously  best safety mechanism educating kids guns
happen  're ready yet even  secure storage would still issue
even well-trained  blogger still wouldn ' want able get hold gun 's
merely concealing gun right ( even without kids  hypothetical blogger wouldn ' want leave gun loose house intruder could run across pick  )
've looked couple things
one electronic combination boxes thumbprint-id boxes  effectively bedside mini-safe
seems reasonable compromise  friend old shootin ' buddy asked someone knowledgeable  got reply  'm inclined agree thatone electronic gizmo one thing could fail really need
simply mechanically offers trouble well
use box like tool storage box key-locking mechanism  keep key ring one 's car keys  keep car keys times
' hang keys hook front hall  ' leave nightstand shower  falls key ring lose keys  're temporarily disarmed get duplicate
might good solution problem
since blogger moving fairly safe area ( perfect  bad ) might best answerthe rational balancing reasonable risks throw gun stand-up gun safe basement kids get old enough try accessible arrangement  rely stout locks  alarm system  local pd  location slugger
unless 's better way hypothetical blogger hasn ' thought yet
anyone could think  'll bet person 's readers could
'll also bet 's lot readers would interested good answer problem
understand wanting shareeven internet aliasdetails home protection setup well-trafficked blog  feel free tip g-mail account ( goseedubgo )
may update post good suggestions  though obviously 'm going tell hypothetical blogger hypothetically chooses !
last detail  one arguments slower accessfor example  keeping semi-auto unloaded without round chamberedwhich used run back read gun magazines person didn ' want get groggy loaded gun hand
've never bought
wake sense something 's wrong  adrenaline clears sleep head instantly
glass cracks  every second counts
updates  great comments e-mails  thank much  keep coming
two themes emerge  safes several people recommended electronic biometric safes despite 'd heard osb 's expert
hand  two people confirmed 'd trouble one
hand  completely mechanical safes called simplex lock bolt furniture floor inside
( 's knowledgeable endorsement ; many different brands recommended  )
aren ' perfectyou train dark one ever failed get one open  looks like best option
realize won ' stop determined burglar unlimited amount time  hopefully dog alarm interrupt leisure
hypothetical blogger goes town contents secure location
stop curious babysitter undisciplined sleepover friend  one main concerns
gets safe working  hypothetical blogger might consider cable lock looped action revolver may may yet  cylinder ' close  looped around heavy furniture
key unlock cable night
's got temporary
recommendations either wear gun times keep locked key lock keep key around neck
sorry  hard explain next cuddle party !
education amazing many people extremely serious  memorable initiation parent made lasting impression
people demonstration gun would melon  received especially person serious lecture warning
happened well 'm interested organization 's eddie eagle program  know sort thing works though 'm sure exactly 'll say  intend try kids get curious guns
case  four asked see dad 's gun
remember quite clearly sitting office  holding giant peacemaker colt  sighting carefully loading gate turned cylinder several times
six would holdhe must turned way four five times
clack clack clack clack
remember distinctly neat clack turn made  seriousness laid-back dad took process impressed importance going  even lecture pointing anyone  etc
followed
suppose like lot matters raising kids  proper parental example far powerful realize
put safe  's subject another weekend oh yeahi told guy 'd plug book  home invasion prevention
looks interesting !
