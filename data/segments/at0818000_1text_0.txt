gop congress appears taking `` every man `` strategy fall elections  gallup given republicans another gift ( americans oppose income redistribution fix economy )
results poll show gop ever gets back preaching adhering simple message used - - one 've previously ridden victory - - 'd shoe-ins number
whether republicans cleaned house enough take advantage something like remains seen
person person running economic platform promises `` restore fairness tax code ``
page campaign website quote came  person also refers bush 's `` tax cuts wealthy instead middle class ``
put two together message person sending public wants take money wealthy give middle class - definition `` income redistribution `` gallup poll measures public opinion
person doesn ' even actively much redistribution happen - let bush tax cuts expire
numbers poll staggering
overall  americans core principle behind person person 's domestic economic policy - - income redistribution - - astounding number % number %
republicans oppose number % -number %  independents oppose number % number %  even democrats oppose number % number %
gallup gold standard polling democrats decades
days  media continually promoting person 's theory `` bringing back fairness `` tax code
fact  `` tax fairness `` war-cry core democrats ' message machine  endlessly promoted minions media  since number
facts mind  particular poll results breathtaking
give idea important even gallup thinks poll  explanatory narrative goes along results written person person  gallup 's chief economist  location  nj - - given choice government address numerous economic difficulties facing today 's consumer  americans overwhelmingly - - number % number % - - prefer government focus improving overall economic conditions jobs situation location location opposed taking steps distribute wealth evenly among americans
americans ' lack support redistributing wealth fix economy spans political parties  republicans ( number % number % ) prefer government focus improving economy  independents ( number % number % ) democrats ( number % number % )
sentiment also extends across income groups  upper-income americans prefer government focus improving economy jobs number % number %  concurring middle-income ( number % number % ) lower-income ( number % number % ) americans
poll  gallup also asked another question - government  general  much little
results question aren ' quite dramatic results income distribution question  poll still shows majority americans believe government much ( read  screwing ) opposed little
separate question finds americans likely believe government many things left individuals businesses ( number % ) opposed saying government solve country 's problems ( number % )
broad question directed specifically economy  reinforces general idea many americans leery much direct government intervention fixing country 's problems
americans incomes  social strata  political affiliations get - - ' tax way  government isn ' right entity save us
republican message americans - - congressional gop became party pork  earmarks  corruption - - keep taxes low focus improving economy job creation encouraging business designed best - employ people make money
old `` limited government `` question - subject heated debate even within ranks conservatives today - - poll shows public clearly thinks less government better government
unless 'm mistaken  results show support - dare say - reagan-brand conservatism
even time - - liberal garbage democrats media relentlessly shove faces - - public faced economic crisis  reagan 's conservative message low taxes limited government still wins
poll clearly shows conservative message  especially economy  gotten
's still unclear  however  current group republicans right ones take gop back majority status
republicans congress united show guts  something seem reluctant
instance  report today 's new york times expansion earmarks ( earmarks persist spending bills number )  especially coming democrats rode victory number promising end  particularly embarrassing gop
true no-brainer  earmark moratorium republicans would send signal fiscal responsibility public time economic crisis democrats would never able match  media would never able cover
coupling promise submit requests funding future non-emergency local projects appropriate committees inserted appropriate bills - - seen debated  including public - - political winner
republicans haven ' taken simple steps year beyond comprehension
' know else said convince gop take logical actions re-embrace conservative values  point fact bunch republican senators congressmen ' get  perhaps next bunch
