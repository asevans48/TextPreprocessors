thanks discussion
host inherent differences  many able specify advanced genetic biological techniques
many blame society  fact aren ' many women hard sciences engineering men  even though women make number % college population
differences men women look world evolutionarily developed massive  denying differences child another option wrong
real world sometimes makes same-sex couple best option  removing ability society prefer optimal partnership raising children alternatives travesty
framing argument important
one side claims one last big hurdles achieving equal rights homosexuals
feel compassion difficult decision
side  though  doesn ' get frame heard media
same-sex marriage  per se  traditional marriage holding optimal situation society
society longer prefer traditional marriage form  same-sex marriage polygamy  etc  society longer prefer optimal situation raising children
appreciate discussion
