many catholic friends support person person upcoming election  despite radically pro-abortion presidential candidate american history
catholics publicly declared support person catholics  arguing faith leads choose obama pro-life candidate  person person
believe overlooked arguments social justice foundation faith social justice  sanctity human life  origin
intent argue legalistically catechism brethren
covered extensively posts last months
want remind parishioners central fact social justice start protection innocent human life  faith allow trade abortion social-justice policies
months ago person person  former official reagan administration prominent catholic  made public endorsement person person stated person 's noble intentions full range social issues made senator 's stance abortion negligible
person addressed every injustice  righted every wrong wiped tear every eye  person seemed reason  complex social ills ages  poverty  war  death penalty human rights would suitably resolved abortion would simply fall organization issue
except  person said first act president sweeping anti-poverty legislation ; end war
first thing 'd president person told naral  sign freedom choice act
person 's argument might sound compelling denver 's archbishop person person admits reasoned similarly person person number one considers person 's priorities
heading human rights person made clear despite suggesting question baby gets human rights paygrade mind person 's right choose basic human right ; singular priority
passionately person believe senator  rates perfect number % naral  unhesitatingly supports procedure known partial birth abortion  act nakedly inhumane running mate voted ban number
beyond savagery  person clearly articulated position baby born alive attempted abortion refused medical attention
logically   president person person whose presidency  told  usher heyday fundamental human rights always support abortion  even extreme  even definition changes infanticide
already seen obama protect infanticide disturbing attempt protect abortion location  nothing said since shows change heart question
abortion reduction agenda obama mush-mouths others  like person  seem interpret wish  kind trickle social economics  poverty eradicated presumably higher taxes  higher energy prices  higher unemployment redistribution wealth priorities war  famine  capitalism injustice taken care ( would include absolutely ensuring woman 's right choose circumstance ) complex messy matters humanity sufficiently resolved  well  abortion issue simply melt away
excuse us  see nothing fantasy mirror image  fact  another fantasy  one holds reversal roe person person simply solve problem abortion
case  fiction misplaced refuses look human heart
president person said number  true culture life can not sustained solely changing laws
need  change hearts
given grief pro-lifers  quite correct
abortion always existed  always exist  long something remains broken within human heart
even beyond  though  consider church supports social-justice issues
faith emphasize fighting poverty oppression mere boy scout merit badges  give catholics something weekends
emphasis social justice springs foundational belief human life sacred  anointed god purposes
need social justice us recognize spark divinity us
abortion says human life
reduces commodity  values based convenience
think human life  rejects entire idea god created humankind  let alone divine purpose
without fundamental understanding faith  kinds horrors become possible abortion  euthanasia  genocide massive scales  war acquisition  exploitation poor
care poor humans divine purpose
kill millions offspring without second thought  leave poor devices
abortion represents ultimate rejection god god 's plan
bear mind person person moderate abortion
location federalize question abortion specific intent striking every moderating state law concerning abortion  parental notification  waiting periods  term limitations  information requirements end passage
also re-impose federal subsidies abortions repealing hyde amendment  forcing taxpayers including catholics pay abortions others
question   boils one reason  reason tell sen
barack obama mere human thin resume seeming propensity shutting  punishing  intimidating otherwise harassing fall line ( force government  possible ) going heal human heart social programs redistributionism
matters heart never resolved worldly machinations
importantly  expect human man human carries within another broken  imperfect heart successfully  righteously disinterestedly resolve issues tested mankind thousands years assign onto inhuman abilities ; smacks idolatry thus flies first fundamental priority believer  gods one  creator
catholicism reject reason faith demands integration two  prayerful discernment  taking action
one 's vote come weighing reason
reason tells us human fetus human deserves inclusion whole notion human rights
candidate consistent notions human rights able acknowledge
reason tells us abortion reduction agenda inconsistent stated priority signing law sweeping  tax-payer funded abortion-rights legislation
reason insists ideology embracing idea genocide whether means eliminating people conceived extra chromosome wiping sovereign nation map warped ideology inconsistent commitment human rights
reason wonders electorate permitted hear presumptive president might say ideologues  reason becomes uncomfortable
reason tells us one human man eradicate poverty
one human man eradicate war
one human man distribute justice nations
history pockmarked graves slaughtered ambitions human men tried perfect justify world  according lights
barack obama inconsistent though hitler  stalin pol pot
however  developing fanciful notion person 's ability man ever done based nothing bit charisma highly overprotective press surrender  rather apply  one 's use reason
tomorrow election day
means  us must vote candidates believe best serve nation
acorn aside  get one vote
pull lever  take time consider whether really applied god-given gift reason
catholics  consider carefully candidate best fits within view human life god 's purpose
