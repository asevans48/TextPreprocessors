suspect  without benefit inside information  person attorney general pick person holder top officials incoming administration would agree
first  investigations prosecutions would tear apart country blow person 's hopes lifting us multiple crises
would people
right  course
standard blackmail - - - either way 'll tear place apart
've gotten away silly things general betrayus hissy fit  know 'll seeing democrats rolling backs total submission minute right starts keening rending garments keeping babies safe
taylor goes explain people ' held responsible committing crimes lawyer told legal ' hold lawyers responsible telling legal used crackpot  untested legal theory support
heck - - - president needs creative lawyer like yoo 's get jail free
( 's interesting concept fully anticipated naive founders  although person might seen possibilities  )
besides  person says waterboarding isn ' necessarily torture congress later legalized whole thing anyway  's problem
really honest mistake rather evil crime
taylor  like toensing  originally supported idea president issuing blanket pardon instituting truth commission  would tear apart country  's
fact  since report potential wmd killing us couple years came couple weeks ago  person convinced person 's going keep gloves
man believed person person allegedly sexually harrassed president years even took office demanded government come complete halt investigate  impatient damned civil libertarians hysterical insistence torturing illegally wiretapping  civil libertarians ' outrage stop
indeed  prospect anyone us inappropriately wiretapped  surveilled  data-mined seems stir viscera many bush critics prospect thousands people murdered terrorists

person need claim use far muscular powers avert catastrophic loss life protect security human-rights activists ( europeans ) would allow
