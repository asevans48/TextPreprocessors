double edged sword
think read following carefully  people bring unlawful ( legal ccw ) onto campus ones ill intent
one recorded incident ccw initiating type massacre
one  fear unfounded
illegal carriers tend pay attention things called laws
's law abiding citizens ccw effective deterrent
think real hard  want `` make name `` killing many capping
intended victims unarmed know  know succeed since schools stupid tell students play dead fight back
words instead teaching survival skills training students lambs slaughter
anyhow since credible threat  go killing spree likely succeed
scenario rules changed targets selected right carry
' know packing isn '
odds getting far pretty slim
slaughter stopped even happens  one person pull gun
thought armed resistance real possibility would enough rational person
oh last bit  almost every massacre location location europe ( location another one


strict gun control ! )
happened gun free zone
think next time go someplace guns allowed
