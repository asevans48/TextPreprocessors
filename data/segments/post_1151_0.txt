anyone feels gay marriage harms traditional marriage surely insecure person
live fluid ever-changing world
surely must come appreciate accept differences within every individual
bigotry roots fear unfamiliar
unfamiliar becomes familiar  fear hatred dissipate
took extremely long time country finally eliminate miscegenation laws
cant move forward peace harmony
one us would simply concentrate making sure lives decent productive without trying disrupt others lives  world would much peaceful harmonious !
