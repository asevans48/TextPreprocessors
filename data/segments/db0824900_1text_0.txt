sacred tribal chantsby digbyso hear organization organization told person campaign ' use barracuda brooks person told person campaign couldn ' use `` location  ``
think pretty good illustration tribal divide country
could tell people convention last night didn ' clue barracuda didn ' relate
thing brooks person tune invesco
waved flags time music little bit incongruous listening sacred tribal chorus person person person person earlier evening
seemed little bit literal
fact artists ' want songs associated `` side `` really telling
identify us much identify
actually like brooks person tune using person 's way reaching  count
'd willing share barracuda side exchange  although ' think 'd like lyrics could understand  real thing ' trickno  better make something quickyou gon na burn burn burn burn wickooooooohhhh  barra barracuda
guess sweet merging ritual hymns
're little bit country 're little bit rock roll never ( location ) twain shall meet
much post-partisanship
let us pray  update  oooops
report heard radio incorrect
sorry
seems brooks person didn ' object
take mean nothing bleeding heart liberals voting person
( actually  guess one one isn '  mean mixed marriage
america ! )
still oddly literal choice `` promise location `` speech  especially since bush 's theme song number
maybe 's makes true post-partisan anthem
would preferred person person 's `` need wake ``   true liberal anthem
location heard radio day person 's speech sing acoustic guitar studio made choke - - -  wanted country  one certainly expresses feelings  although certainly isn ' post-partisan  digby number/number/number number  number  number pm linktocomments ( ' number ' ) postcount ( ' number ' ) ; | postcounttb ( ' number ' ) ;
