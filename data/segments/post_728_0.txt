're thinking wrong
'm advocating blowing away everyone might threatening
someone brought without permanently hurting  also keeping person threatened safe  's fine
'm advocating police blowing away every whackjob knife pipe
saying someone gun  threatening shoot someone  already shot someone  trying use less-than-lethal methods neutralize isn ' good idea
put simply  gun best way make bad guys go away
room fumbling beanbag shotgun someone executing people
take virginia tech example
shooter going classroom classroom shooting people  `` execution-style ``  media likes call
case  trying get rid without hurting killing would allow kill people  police try taser
back self-defense issue - pepper spray tasers drunk guy bar getting little friendly
people trying kill
'm advocating replacing pepper spray gun
pepper spray 's purpose - gun
someone trying kill  want get rid threat quickly possible
less-lethal options never effective gun purpose
main point always value human life  shouldn ' caught allow others   harmed result inability take decisive action
