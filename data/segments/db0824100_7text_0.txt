protest politicsby digbyi haven ' able keep protests outside convention  couple posts   second footage
haven ' seen pepper spray action  attest fact anti-abortion forces place police ' seem concerned protesters
trucks pictures fetuses driving around lots middle aged men holding photos bloody masses screaming shouldn ' even allowed vote
ubiquitous
wonder would happen bunch anti-war protestors showed location huge posters dead maimed iraqi children
think police crowds would tolerant
pictures dead children whose parents didn ' health care dead children died diseases stem cell research may cure
somehow doubt
graphically showing death fully formed humans outside womb considered bad taste unnecessarily provocative
would probably consider disturbing peace
