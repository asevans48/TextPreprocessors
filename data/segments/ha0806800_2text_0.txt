president person veto recently passed intelligence authorization bill restrictions organization interrogation techniques
explain veto weekly radio address  claiming takes vital tools away counterterrorism agents conflict tools needed
conflict sets showdown congress  presidential election  media apparently determined misreport  person person absolutely support waterboarding  post misrepresents issue entirely
person person supports veto supports waterboarding  person believes already illegal
made plain ever since bill came floor vote
bill number already made practice illegal  least opinion  portion bill addresses superfluous
person sees dangerously limiting organization  two reasons
first  army field manual applies different set circumstances organization faces  primarily army faces different enemy field much different mission organization
afm appropriately limits actions interrogators  isn ' ur-text constitutes doesn ' constitute torture
method doesn ' make afm doesn ' mean 's torture international convention
secondly person ' said strongly enough wildly inappropriate publish limits interrogatory technique organization
left imagination enemie  two reasons
one  publication allows enemies prepare limit techniques published  making successful interrogation much difficult achieve
second  limits remain unknown allows fear might happen make less-intensive techniques effective
mccain opposed bill reasons  supposedly reversed waterboarding
problems legislation ' involve techniques much involves strategic stupidity
