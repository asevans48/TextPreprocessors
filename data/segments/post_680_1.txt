won ' things want gun violence high continue push banning guns restricting guns fewer fewer people
brady campaign shame push ban so-called `` assault weapons `` really semi-automatic guns  different  fact less powerful number % hunting rifles  claim rifles used mass killings assaults
problem logic less number % gun related crime committed so-called `` assault weapons ``
obviously brady campaign says want logical compromise  really mean outright bans guns  except personally approve
