yesterday  thinkprogress highlighted latest reason bush administration oppose real gi bill troops  offered senators person person
organization spokesperson said  part  [ w ] e certainly concerned would eligible two years service
think pegging longer period service number mind  point  six years service longer stay  sweeter benefits
six years would show commitment service
last thing want provide benefit last thing want create situation losing men women worked hard train
wow
serious flaws logic  first  time service isn ' measure commitment service
troops served six years  tours location  came back without limb  could longer serve
shown less commitment america
would love spokesperson go person person tell anyone served three years  can not continue service  haven ' shown commitment
second  one leaving military two years
'd note sign  's eight year contract  four years active
serve number ways
example  served four half years active ( stop lossed )  went grad school served reserves  called back ten months
point remains 're talking flood people breaking contract three four years
overwhelming majority men women serve contract eight years  even begin school 're done active duty commitment  military call time need  life troop 's contract
gi bill isn ' going change
third administration serious retention  would focus role contractors  continually snatch troops  offering number times military pay similar job location
's much bigger threat retention offering service-member chance get quality education
personally  took months got back get contractors stop calling  offering six-figures  tax-free  work location
didn ' take  far leave make money
blame troops  way
families provide  're going take dangerous task  's far attractive lot money  leave families
fact administration hasn ' taken contractors 's embraced
administration continues dole bloated contracts private contractors  instead increase size military  address war location overextended forces
result contracts spent  large part  lure away members military
latest spin organization isn ' nonsense 's offensive nonsense  insults intelligence service members recognize administration never serious retention
otherwise  would done something contractors long  long time ago
