way  entire concept biofuels currently applied makes sense
instead using food actually feed people even animals  use feed cars
ethanol suddenly lost luster alternative energy source food prices skyrocketed  including global-warming-sympathizing europe  perhaps turning food transportation fuel would make sense massive amounts grain spoiled every year lack demand  certainly isn ' case
farmers love higher prices come new demand fill gas tanks  higher prices consequences poorer nations begun felt
morally speaking  shouldn ' feed people feed cars
makes even absurd ethanol
burns cleaner  significant problems transportation fuel
two-thirds potential energy gasoline  means used get mileage
ethanol shipped truck can not pumped pipeline  much energy get expended bring market
order use small amount mixture  car engines designed differently use  means energy resources go producing vehicles
every fill tank ethanol uses amount corn child would eat year  let 's even talk amount potable water used grow corn first place
given  better use corn
produce ethanol waste switchgrass  shows promise ethical problem would exist  although certainly efficiency issues would remain
end push turn food fuel  driven global-climate-change hysteria pandering agricultural sector
feed people ahead cars
really difficult concept
