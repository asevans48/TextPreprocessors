presidential campaigns computer gaming intersected election cycle first time
ea sports included advertising person person nine games  xbox versions  run election day  sounds like smart move team person  although plays demographic obama already  voters low reliability actually showing election day
money innovate  though  won ' likely lose much transaction
ads could get millions views relatively low cost
wonder ea sports marketing  though
first  accepting political ads unnecessarily annoys least part market
moreover  players see ads
invest hundreds dollar game system  spend plenty money game play
spent kind money playing person number  'd resent ea sports 's attempt exploit even money advertisers  especially products ' want like
course  ' play person number ea sports games  perhaps rely lack sophistication among clientele hope ' know better
would certainly explain obama ads
update  's early  think would win comment day  thing
bishop  ouch
