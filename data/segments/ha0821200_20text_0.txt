last month  person person announced person party would take donations federally-registered lobbyists pacs
somehow  news failed make campaign
roll call took peek lobbying disclosures first half number  discovered $ number donations dozens lobbyists  roll call asked person campaign explain apparent reversal policy
team person claimed would refund donation find came lobbyist rely lobbyists identify time donation
seems little strange ; rely lobbyists honest  person reject contributions
besides  lobbyists say person 's lips say  fundraisers say yes  campaign says return contributions soon lobbyists
could make easier quit sending many requests donations
've written  really tiresome pointless exercise
lobbyists represent americans policy matters  unless 're conducting bribery  's constitutional exercise
issue isn ' lobbyists expansive amount spoils grab federal level
candidate wants reduce influence lobbyists  would enact policies shrink reach cost federal government
person person 's policies exactly opposite  expanding government control spending  increasing spoils lobbyists given elected representatives
's easy
cut spending  reduce size government  get rid corrupting influence lobbying brings
fact  person wanted keep lobbyists supporting campaign  's exactly could best would voluntary system lobbyists would certainly comply
