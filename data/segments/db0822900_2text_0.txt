( person chose july numberth  number  )
's latest teaser person person mojo  agree probably real story  reportedly  person person considered person 's vp
'm buying
series headfakes person campaign  right
creating media speculation different options one week person  one week biden  one week person person keeps people talking choice almost month
ultimately  find better choice three  meaning even actual choice flawed  people still say  `` whew
better options  anyway  ``
's  though  think
