course
ever hear make remarks could considered controversial sat church
yes
strongly disagree many political views
absolutely 'm sure many heard remarks pastors  priests  rabbis strongly disagreed
mr
obama 's previous statements longer operative
's okay
everybody
doesn ' pastor  priest talk like
course
fact comments made issues surfaced last weeks reflect complexities race country 've never really worked part union yet perfect
walk away  simply retreat respective corners  never able come together solve challenges like health care  education  need find good jobs every american
understanding reality requires reminder arrived point
mr
wright telling us condemn mr
wright hatred ignorance  need understand improve apologize ancestors mr
wright won ' get angry say things
mr
wright saying public black people feel private
moreover  whites hate-filled wright blacks
black anger often proved counterproductive  white resentments distracted attention real culprits middle class squeeze corporate culture rife inside dealing  questionable accounting practices  short-term greed ; location dominated lobbyists special interests ; economic policies favor many
course  always  corporations ultimately blame
profound mistake reverend wright 's sermons spoke racism society
's spoke society static ; progress made ; country country made possible one members run highest office land build coalition white black ; latino asian  rich poor  young old still irrevocably bound tragic past

nonsense
profound mistake mr

us founded racism
location number one killer world
create aids kill black man

outrageous things mr
wright claims
damnable lies whether upward mobility minorities
( weirdly  lies calculated spread hate distrust government people want run everything  )
moreover  social dynamism mr

wright 's sermon day
detailed dreams father  page number  world  world cruise ships throw away food day residents port-au-prince see year  white folks ' greed runs world need  apartheid one hemisphere  apathy another hemisphere 's world !
hope sits !
yes  audacity hope ( sic ) sermon mr
person says gave much inspiration changed life
problems world fault white greed
however  truth exactly opposite
capitalism ( greed ) solved solve world 's problems let
text ( obviously sanitized ) mr
wright 's bizarre audacity hope sermon  go
bookworm choice analysis
couple brief excerpts  obama points correctly fact 's tagged black black enough
's interesting point  inadvertently  highlights obsession within democratic community race substantive virtues  experienced enough
little experience
liberal
liberal enough
corrupt
corrupt ordinary politician
less corrupt hillary
focus race  one 's asking questions ought asked
