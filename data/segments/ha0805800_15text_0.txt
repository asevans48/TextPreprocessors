democrats discovered badly constructed college delegates cycle
used superdelegate structure since mid-numbers  one foresaw could appear two candidates split vote almost equally
one architects democratic delegate structure defends concept today 's location post saying one else establishment smarter electorate  everyone understand
hunt tries explain small words  democratic primary voters understand
establishment understands winning better voters
voters gave democrats george mcgovern person person
thankfully  establishment produced person person person person
hunt tough job
's essentially defending indefensible
party wants offer primaries state caucuses produce nominees  structure race results determine winner
reserving number % delegate vote establishment  almost guaranteed primary two credible popular candidates wind open convention
means democrats either limit one attractive candidate per cycle big donors party leaders chase candidates away  need play kingmaker conventions
republicans problem
number % delegates represent gop establishment  presents problems determinative primary race
also force pledged delegates vote pledged candidates first ballot  democrats apparently
although complain winner-take-all states republican side  overall result reflects popular vote democratic superdelegates reject whim  hunt argues leeway
's ironic democratic party seems bigger problem democratic results
cross posted captain 's quarters
