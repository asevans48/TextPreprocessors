think everything public life guided faith  affected faith  without transferring official way people
's fight poverty
's fight clean environment protect earth
's fight equality justice
things come fundamental teaching belief faith
know  president person inaugural address told us earth  god 's work must truly
's - - think 's test public service
schieffer  mr
president
bush  think 's important promote culture life
think hospitable society society every counts every person matters
believe ideal world one every child protected law welcomed life
understand 's great differences issue abortion  believe reasonable people come together put good law place help reduce number abortions
take  example  ban partial birth abortion
's brutal practice
people political parties came together halls congress voted overwhelmingly ban practice
made lot sense
opponent  's mainstream  voted law
'm saying  promote life promote culture life  surely ways work together reduce number abortions  continue promote adoption laws - - 's great alternative abortion - - continue fund promote maternity group homes ; continue promote abstinence programs
last debate  opponent said wife involved programs
's great
appreciate much
us ought involved programs provide viable alternative abortion
schieffer  mr
president  let 's new question
goes
let 's get back economic issues
health insurance costs risen number percent last four years according washington post
're paying
're getting less
would like ask  bears responsibility
government
insurance companies
lawyers
doctors
administration
bush  gosh  sure hope 's administration
's - -  look  's systemic problem
health-care costs rise consumers involved decision-making process
health-care costs covered third parties
therefore  actual user health care purchaser health care
's market forces involved health care
's one reasons 'm strong believer call health savings accounts
accounts allow somebody buy low-premium  high-deductible catastrophic plan couple tax-free savings
businesses contribute  employees contribute contractual basis
way make sure people actually involved decision-making process health care
secondly  believe lawsuits - - ' believe  know - - lawsuits causing health-care costs rise location
's 'm strong believer medical liability reform
last debate  opponent said lawsuits caused cost go number percent
well  didn ' include defensive practice medicine costs federal government $ number billion year costs society $ number billion $ number billion year
thirdly  one reasons 's still high cost medicine - - ' use information technology
's like looked - - 's equivalent buggy horse days  compared industries location
've got introduce high technology health care
're beginning
're changing language
want electronic medical records cut error  well reduce cost
people tell health-care field fully integrated information technology  'll wring number percent cost system
finally  moving generic drugs market quicker
four ways help control costs health care
schieffer  senator person
kerry  reason health-care costs getting higher  one principal reasons administration stood way common-sense efforts would reduced costs
let give prime example
senate passed right americans import drugs location
president friends took house  ' right
president blocked right less expensive drugs location
also wanted medicare able negotiate bulk purchasing
va
va provides lower-cost drugs veterans
could done medicare
medicare paid american taxpayer
medicare belongs
medicare seniors  many fixed income  lift poverty
rather help  taxpayer  lower cost  rather help seniors less expensive drugs  president made illegal - - illegal - - medicare actually go bargain lower prices
result  $ number billion windfall profit drug companies coming pockets
's large part number percent increase medicare premiums
'm president  'm sending back congress 're going get real prescription drug benefit
also people sicker ' health insurance
whether 's diabetes cancer  come hospitals later costs america
got health care americans
schieffer  go ahead  mr
president
bush  think 's important  since talked medicare plan  location location senate number years
record reforming health care
record
introduced number bills 's passed five
record leadership
came location solve problems
deeply concerned seniors choose prescription drugs food
led
number  seniors get prescription drug coverage medicare
schieffer  senator person
thirty seconds
kerry   president misleading america
've actually passed number individual bills 've personally written  addition  always name  amendments certain bills
importantly  respect question record  helped write - - write  one original authors early childhood health care expansion health care middle numbers
'm proud
president 's wrong
schieffer  let direct next question  senator person   let 's stay health care
proposed president commented tonight  proposed massive plan extend health-care coverage children
're also talking government picking big part catastrophic bills people get hospital
said pay rolling back president 's tax cut upper number percent
heard president say earlier tonight 's going cost whole lot money
'd ask  going get money
kerry  well  two leading national news networks said president 's characterization health-care plan incorrect
one called fiction
called untrue
fact health-care plan  location  simple
gives choice
' force anything
's government plan
government doesn ' require anything
choose doctor
choose plan
' want take offer plan want put forward  '
keep today  keep high deductible  keep high premiums  keep high co-pay  keep low benefits
got better plan
' think lot people going want keep today
's  take medicaid children states every child location covered
exchange  states want - - 're forced  choose - - cover individuals number percent poverty
's choice
think 'll choose  's net plus $ number billion
allow - - choose  ' - - give broader competition allow buy health care plan senators congressmen give
's good enough us  's good enough every american
believe health care important politician location  d c want buy
give broader competition
helps lower prices
addition  're going allow people number number buy medicare early
importantly  give small business number percent tax credit lower costs health care  also get  whether 're self-employed small business  lower cost able cover employees
happens begin get people covered like - - instance diabetes  diagnose diabetes early  could save $ number billion health care system location avoiding surgery dialysis
works
'm going offer location
schieffer  mr
president
bush  due respect  'm sure 's credible quote leading news organizations - - oh  never mind
anyway  let quote lewin report
lewin report group folks politically affiliated
analyzed senator 's plan
cost $ numbernumber trillion
lewin report accurately noted going number million people  number million people added government-controlled health care
would largest increase government health care ever
raise medicaid number percent  provides incentive small businesses provide private insurance employees
insure somebody government 's going insure
's estimated number million people go private insurance government insurance
fundamental difference opinion
think government - run health lead poor-quality health  lead rationing  lead less choice
health-care program ends line item federal government budget  leads controls
look countries tried federally controlled health care
poor-quality health care
health-care system envy world believe making sure decisions made doctors patients  officials nation 's capital
schieffer  senator
kerry  president said government-run health care results poor quality
maybe explains hasn ' fully funded va va hospital trouble veterans complaining
maybe explains medicare patients complaining pushed medicare
doesn ' adequately fund
let say america  proposing government-run program
's
blue cross/blue shield
senators congressmen wide choice
americans ought
schieffer  mr
president
bush  talk va  've increased va funding $ number billion four years since 've president
's twice amount predecessor increased va funding
course 're meeting obligation veterans  veterans know

know social security running money  fixed
proposed fix letting people put money collected pay benefits private savings accounts
critics saying 's going mean finding $ number trillion next number years continue paying benefits accounts set
