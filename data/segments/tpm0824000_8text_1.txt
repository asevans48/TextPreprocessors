case point - - took  think would tell asked  convince person use force location
kept saying un would go
said ' go un - - 'm internationalist - - said ' go un  're going get answer
know  know world knows 's genocide taking place continent europe
obligation lead french follow
gigantic departure orthodoxy left also center party
center party
m  ask hypothetical
happened location say decided ask un ask organization got yes
didn ' beforehand  went organization agreed
m  okay
b  went organization agreed attempted make organization operation convinced would happen french germans would exposed
knew 've done  political center political leadership europe able generate consensus
timid
's location must remain european power
acting made impossible location france act
ironically go back look polling data  predicted time turned true
seventy-five percent people location location thought - - countries act location
leaders  weak clear mandate people - - weak personally  weak terms either coalition governments bare majorities parliaments - - unwilling take chance
think 'd see person administration willing exercise force face - - two conditions pertained
one  exercise force likely result outcome seeking
difference exercising force location force location physical wherewithal likely allies able succeed exercising force
classic judgment needs made doableness
doable  new circumstances quote `` integrity nation `` violated 're engaged genocide  're clearly unequivocally harboring terrorists done damage  beyond question whether attack  preemption like
's preemption  new standard basically forfeit sovereignty nation state
can not claim civilized nation 're engaged genocide
every place genocide  intervene
practical capacity
two exist  think see person administration exercise power
like administration president person seventh year - -  remember  love republicans  face overwhelming republican opposition
second thing  's kind new standard emerged think combination refer enlightened nationalism
operated national interests every circumstance umbrella international rules international community
damage danger irrefutable  reserve right act interest interest humanity  capacity
different standard existed first number years location location senator
different standard rationale neoconservative friends
argue exercise force important apex power enlightened rest world
ability exercise force allows us leverage power direct proportion moral disapprobation rest world
say  guys going hell lot - - 's ten people room 's guy hall screaming 's bothering us say ought stop guy  ought stop guy
everyone says  `` oh  guy 's bad guy  gon na cause problems 'll organization organization organization organization `` say  ' care hell think get go beat shit guy  come back sit
're going look around
misbehave  say  `` hey man  `` 're going go `` whoa  whoa  whoa  ``
nine guys aren ' going able constrain
doesn ' care anybody else thinks
's mean leveraging power
m  demonstration effect
b  exactly  's thing  've probably read guys well
're pretty smart guys
bunch christian coalition guys
serious  serious people
patriotic americans
guys really truly aren ' looking get organization contracts - - 's ancillary benefit
guys really think - - person person idealist
really thinks impose democracy
agree democracy - - world  middle east democratic institution  fact interests greatly enhanced democracies tend go war democracies
's far cry able impose
person administration understand  view - - know long time  know person well
need work hard establish soil seeds liberal democratic institutions take root
means public diplomacy  means engaged economic initiatives  means political interchange  means everything student exchange programs saying step across line 'm going blow kingdom come
mix things
guys ' think  think soft power useless
listen read nye 's book soft power  ridiculed guys
well let tell  soft power enough  ' get ultimate - - take look - - children
m  '
b  okay  let 's assume - - tomorrow 're getting married year young child think well hell - - 's kid 're asked write senior thesis know year number asked question  major problems facing humanity turn numberst century
would probably list everything proliferation weapons mass destruction  growth international terror nexus weapons mass destruction  great disparity organization organization organization growth third fourth world  spread epidemics pandemics like aids  name
growth radicalism - - particular numbernumber billion muslims world - - single one lends military solution
one
least three may require exercise military force exercise solution
internationalists - - number percent party argued military solution basically never solution unless 're physically attacked
republican side says solution neoconservative approach  international organization lilliputians tying gulliver  us
includes  way  organization
think  wax nostalgically  weren ' nato 'd another number troops deploy
hell need
know - - know fully understand
know president always brags
said long ago  `` person  ' nuance  `` real cool thing  right
mean literally  's quote
said  `` 's nuanced situation  mr
president  `` said  `` ' nuance  mr
chairman  ``
well know - - person 's accused nuanced
well let tell something  lot simple requires use one tool toolbox
see emerging  think  think person administration  intersection  oversimplify  adherence  value  promotion international institutions like grandfathers end wwii wouldn ' carry whole load whole world time  willingness exercise force need enforce rules road 're violated
case point  imagine number/number president location location sent secretary state vice president europe said  need new international consensus two important points
number one - - least us-european consensus - - must policy short deterrence available us
either non-action deterrence retaliation  must something new situation
neocons right  first time stateless actors territory protect  interest protecting individuals  capable using modern technology  let alone  let alone nuclear weapons weapons mass destruction - - take chlorine filled train tanker blow tunnel underneath supreme court location location location
fully within range possibility
' need weapons mass destruction
tunnel runs union station supreme court organization building
rayburn building
hole big little mini hiroshima
's like running plane organization running plane capitol
's much damaging
combination technology  sophistication  laptop computers cave location location
could orchestrate
've never faced
m  ask question
seems one shortcomings neoconservative worldview precisely focus states
b  exactly right  bingo
m  okay
b  're one three goddamn guys 've gotten
m  well  - - b   really mean  ask norm [ communication director norm person ]
mean norm 's sit  listening things
point trying desperately make colleagues tried articulate person ' show
fundamental flaw neo - - forget flaw  fundamental difference person person  person person one hand  neoconservatives genuinely believe - - 'll put negative sense - - believe possible sophisticated international criminal network rain terror upon country  potential kill number people country  exist without sponsorship nation state
really truly believe - - axis evil speech - - able decapitate regimes location  location  north location  would fact dry tentacles terror
think fundamentally flawed reasoning
every one regimes became liberal democracy tomorrow  anybody think wouldn ' code orange tomorrow location location
rhetorical question
anybody think ' worry next major event like location occurring paris location location location
gim me break
really believe way
aide  point  parenthetically  exactly argument person person making discussion supposedly person
tried convince person point person didn ' get right
mean read excerpts
b  forgot
aide  mean  right  much point
b  well see guys aren ' stupid 's like guys venal bunch guys
really smart guys
m  's quote - - ' remember word word - - person person basically said 's fundamental insight strategy continuing centrality states
b  exactly right  think 's fundamentally mistaken  fundamentally mistaken
going make kind ad hominem arguments usually make debates  guys like - - guys serious discussion know  's name  conservative weekly standard publication - - ( unintelligible crosstalk aide ) b  person
person sits person argues makes case without ad hominem arguments - - way person 'd responded would say  `` well  telling 's terror guys running [ show ]  ``
yeah

eliminate  life blood flows organizations
much important us able go sources funding
's like organized crime
love thing  's law enforcement

intelligence  cutting source supply money  infiltrating organization beyond bombing training bases
bombing training bases  's good thing way

reason 's dangerous 're  approach - - 's intentional  takes eye ball
's wrong focus
take look - - 's presumptuous say - - take look speech delivered numberth september  number  day
actually number hours  number hours happened
argument  guys - - like us  greatest strength greatest weakness
greatest strength ability focus
every republican administration concluded important lesson presidential governance reagan
focus
one biggest criticisms - - generic criticisms person
many foci
guys focus
came office one  two overwhelming preoccupations  necessarily expense everything else
's much gray matter able brought subject matter administration
criticism  kind hard walk chew gum time stuff

number  number people administration intellectual energy center administration
every administration
focus
national missile defense  day took office exclusion everything else
preoccupation palpable
's made speech
didn ' know going come numberth  said going come gon na come relatively soon
ignored - - 'm arguing could stopped number-number
arguing resources - - intellectual  political  military resources - - focused  except keep everything else bouncing along  national missile defense
number/number  focus went - - whoosh  location
lose
m  part connection mind missile defense first place
b  bingo  bingo  bingo  bingo
got
hire guy  ' pay enough
seriously  joke
think
many colleagues anyone else got connection

consequences
one consequences - - guys want get rid organization organization anybody  want person person person private parts  mean want chop  guys - - 's ' care
preoccupation require
required president choose person rumsfeld 's advice powell 's advice expanding international security force location

four days  three days  five days
whatever hell  met every major - - location well - - met every major military figure country  including brits others
every military man said  've got expand security force
guys said  oh
two neoconservative principles pertained
joking
one bring  're going constrain ability go organization organization 're going coordinate
second one trumped first
're going put enough forces really get organization organization  'll draining forces resources efforts location  really want
result
turned warlords  basically
assure - - conversation condi rice january  - - almost year later january
said  person  meet week  're supposed - - telephone meeting  long story

looked said  well  know  started explaining
said  `` look  organization organization 's  organization 's
's security  ``
said  mean turning warlords
said  `` yeah  's always way  ``
's little piece - - confuse  ' know write
see piece came  split among neoconservatives  nation builders guys said  ' build nations
person rumsfeld among others finding convenient say  consistent neocon principles  're going move location  also ' give crap rebuilding
look  remember game kid  'd go boardwalk rented place two weeks rained parents didn ' know
called whack-a-mole
little mole pops head hit
well guys believe whack-a-mole
believe guys come back  organization comes back  'll go back crush
's logical  's realistic  's never nation state consequence  ' anyway  way  location
's happened
attacks location location didn ' get person [ means bin laden ]
' know  let tell something  seems diverted attention - - dad used say  god rest soul  joey  first things first
everything equally important  nothing priority  son
m  's question neoconservatives sort difference sort different grand views
b  didn ' hear  say
m  oh  let start
looking sort grand strategic view
first started  wrote lot location  buildup war
struck  even though seemed lots gaps logic sort thought  strength  broadest sense - - agree  sort like location  location  location location could become liberal democracies tomorrow  'd still organization organization - - long-term view  rule-of-law states blah blah blah blah  long-term strategic interest
b  absolutely
m  seems  able  ones  debate carried number  say  done last number years  time side  're playing losing game associating different autocratic states
b  isn ' ironic guys said criticized location location  went bullshit white house rest
're right  're right right  way
'll read  saying leading war war  let 's discriminating
makes lot sense
makes lot sense change map middle east
let 's realistic american people
let 's read little history
'm ready make investment
let 's smart
's person  lock-step stuff
held hearings
held hearings chairman followed
didn ' hold hearings taking person
's good thing
good thing
held hearings  day  decade
first-rate hearings
self-serving thing say - - go take look
established beyond reasonable doubt went alone  would lose alone end
cost going multi-billion dollar  commitment troops going minimum force number people least five years  probably many ten
would maintain support american people  better damned well explain ask
didn ' listen
would oil rebuild
mean  everybody thinks say stuff hindsight
go back look saying
aide  new york times op-ed day hearings began
's biden-lugar op-ed lays purpose - - b  go look report wrote hearings  set methodically  basically president said two months later  early september  said  `` person  aren '  ``
cabinet room
ten senators congressmen so-called foreign policy leadership

looked
said  `` secondly  mr
president  'll two conditions
guarantee 're prepared stay five years  publicly address american people tell going take
level  ``
everybody  matter fact  colleagues  'd kid  'd quote kept repeating
'd say  foreign policy sustained  matter well-formed location location  without informed consent american people
m  think  least foreign policy brain trust  let 's say neoconservative foreign policy brain trust administration  realized dollar signs troop levels talking trying create  basically fait accompli  one thinking right thing  - - b  ' think - - think split
think actually believed horseshit  going money  garlands going beat feet
democratizers believed  think
' think person believed second
' think person
think knew didn ' move swiftly  may consensus move
's think vastly exaggerated threat
create sense urgency
look polling data held hearings - - july
july
' hold exact numbers get ' em
get
think something like number  number  number % american people going location
hearings finished  without anything else happening  number number number %
didn ' go unnoticed
figured  got ta create sense urgency
've got rationale
's rationale 's guarantee
m  nuclear - - b  nuclear weapons
face number/number  's one
weapons mass destruction  coordination terrorists
wasn ' freaking shred evidence
case ' think 'm  monday morning quarterbacking  self-defense  serious reporters like said  `` hey  wait minute
say time  ``
went back record
'll give - - got
- - excerpt things said contemporaneously  like vice president person saying  've reconstituted nuclear capability
contemporaneous time frame  said  saw single shred evidence
didn ' believe moment
unless weren ' showing information supposed  vice president ill-informed
made argument connection organization organization

said contemporaneously  thing foreign policy press every month couple hours conference room  come coffee ask questions couple hours
said  well  saying time  president 's lying
said   's lying
president telling whole truth
president leading american people believe entire intelligence community concluded aluminum tubes gas centrifuge system get highly enriched uranium
community split
notice  oughtta get - - presumptuous say  people missed  tenet 's speech georgetown
single important sentence speech  'll paraphrase
said  never told president location location america anyone administration person imminent threat
'm gon na dig
implication every single thing everyone said  including president
' act  man  're mortal danger
' take chance
new doctrine preemption
're lowering bar low terms burden proof  damage potentially high  ' wait
created semi-sense hysteria guy threat
never threat  near term
good thing 's gone  good thing began implement vision
'm going say something outrageously self-serving
two years earlier location conference got living crap kicked speaking one plenary sessions  saying problem arab friends 're causing us problems
's interest democratize
choice  '  disengage
administration publicly criticized
m  roughly
