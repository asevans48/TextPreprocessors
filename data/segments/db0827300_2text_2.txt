( see fascinating interview person person person primer works  )
crises  usual suspects swoop take advantage situation leave average people holding bag
's disorienting see happen biggest economy world  's really structural reason shouldn ' happen us
concept doctrine prepared take advantage openings - - - opening
shock doctrine depends upon complexity
politics depends simplicity
republicans relying voters ' common sense reaction something seems favor people caused problem
's hard argue might persuade people know real enemy smite - - - big government wall street
( case  's smart move party power needs rebuild discredited
' afford associated know  )
democrats failing take advantage complexity situation use simple politics sell
say economy failing need massive government action solve
's democrats crisis like
need make political message democratic agenda restoring economy rescuing `` financial system `` nobody understands anyway
sure  need something shore financial markets  means restore confidence kind psychological parlor game based upon assumptions nobody measure advance
middle class tax cuts like candy ' seem resist  suppose keep  ( although wish 'd take table point 's self defeating constantly saying everyone taxed  )
democrats must also make case conservative policies creating massive income inequality  starving nation 's infrastructure  neglect health care crisis ignoring immediate need invest alternative energy green jobs ( mention useless wars ) part economic instability experiencing - - - addressing needs vital restoring economy
aren ' good ideas merits  necessary security
readers know  believe democrats make aggressive argument progressive policies liberal principles
' mind someone saying work others  object saying republicans good ideas '
radical policies led us moment failed somebody needs tell american people exactly offer clear alternative
crisis opportunity spell clearly question generation ideas toxic adjustable rate mortgage

political question driver 's seat time
clearly  country operating without president right - - - person absolutely juice get anything done administration discredited ' rally public

let 's argument let american people decide
democrats win mandate real progressive change middle crisis demands
play cards right 'll end neutering failed conservative ideology generation  put place important long neglected structural changes mitigate worst downturn time
's reason shock doctrine ' used good
update  ooops
perlstein long  let person person guide
take granted one signature political innovations  idea executive `` legislative agenda  `` specific set white house proposals  success failure presidency judged
fdr 's first spectacular
understood new deal would pass quickly would pass
politically  yoked congress ' willingness pass program without obstruction congress ' willingness address national emergency tout court
