consensus last night 's debate  blogosphere commentariat  formed quickly rather inexplicably failed dull
people see blamed person person spicing  candidates putting people watching sleep
ironically  comes people complain lack substance policy plethora sound-bite gotchas political debates
last night 's debate shows get candidates focus policy ( mostly ) avoid sound bites gotchas
debate  political equivalent roman forum match game slightly less salacious questions
candidates best lay policy preferences records  person person aggressive contrasting person person  mainly sticking policies records
real debates ' make good public spectacles
high school debates ' get held stadiums gymnasiums friday nights front massive crowds
bands conduct halftime shows cheerleaders appear  unless coincidentally cheerleader member debate squad
good reason
real debates tend dull everyone except people involved  interested topic discussion
everyone complains candidates ' provide substantive discussion policy  appears truth people media interested substantive debate
need headlines hooks  find actual debate substance waste time
truth ' want debate  real debate nothing much compare position papers well-established policy
want bloodsport  cage match two candidates joust rhetorical death  breathlessly report every injury act superior chastising everyone providing substance
maybe two candidates provide crowds really want final debate october numberth
better yet  maybe media think reaction realize waste time presidential debates  usually reward glibness appearance penalizing substance detail
otherwise  let 's give people really want add person person  person white  big spinning wheel entertain people affairs
