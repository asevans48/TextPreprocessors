've bailed soviet agriculture huge grain sales
've given large loans  access best technology senate hadn ' interfered jackson amendment  maybe - would 've given even larger loans

let cite several examples
shortly became president uh - december number  met uh - general secretary brezhnev location agreed mutual cap ballistic missile launchers ceiling twenty-four hundred - means location location  becomes permanent agreement  make reduction launchers plan
've negotiated location uh - mr
brezhnev limitation mirving ballistic missiles figure thirteen-twenty  first time president achieved cap either launchers mirvs
seems go uh - uh - grain sales
grain sales benefit misc agriculture
achieved five three quarter year uh - sale minimum six million metric tons  means already bought four million metric tons year bound buy another two million metric tons take grain corn wheat american farmers produced order uh - full production
grain sales soviet union helped us tremendously meeting costs additional oil - oil bought overseas
turn location - 'm glad raised  mr
uh - person
case location  thirty-five nations signed agreement  including secretary state organization - ' circumstances believe - holiness  pope would agree signing agreement thirty-five nations turned warsaw pact nations domination - eastern europe
isn ' true
mr

number one  agreement notify us notify uh - military maneuvers undertaken
done
cases 've done  soviet domination eastern europe never ford administration
ms
frederick  governor carter
mr
person  'm sorry  - could follow - understand say  sir  russians using eastern europe sphere influence occupying mo - countries - making sure troops 's - 's communist zone  whereas side line italians french still flirting possibility communism
mr
ford  ' believe  uh - mr
person uh - yugoslavians consider dominated location location

' believe poles consider dominated location location
countries independent  autonomous  territorial integrity location location concede countries domination location location
matter fact  visited location  location rumania make certain people countries understood president location location people united dedicated independence  autonomy freedom
ms
frederick  governor carter  may response
mr
carter  ( chuckle ) well  first place  'm criticizing holiness pope
talking mr
ford
uh - fact secrecy surrounded decisions made ford administration
case location agreement - may good agreement beginning  failed enforce so-called basket three part  insures right people migrate  join families  free  speak
location location still jamming radio free europe - radio - uh - uh - radio free europe jammed
've also seen serious uh - problem so-called sonnenfeldt document  apparently mr
ford endorsed  said 's organic linkage eastern european countries location location
would like see mr
ford convince polish-americans czech-americans hungarian-americans country countries ' live domination supervision soviet union behind iron - uh - curtain
also seen mr
ford exclude access public
hasn ' tough cross-examination-type press conference thirty days
one press conference without sound
's also shown weakness yielding pressure
location location  instance  put pressure mr
ford refused see symbol human freedom recognized around world  person person
arabs put pressure mr
ford  's yielded  permitted boycott arab countries american businesses trade location  american jews owning taking part management american - companies
secretary commerce subpoenaed congress reveal names businesses subject boycott
didn ' volunteer information
subpoenaed
last thing 'd like say  grain deal organization organization ' number terrible  mr
ford made three embargoes  one ally location
's way run foreign policy  including international trade
ms
frederic  mr
trewhitt  question governor carter
mr
trewhitt  governor  'd like pick point  actually  appeal greater measure misc idealism foreign affairs
foreign affairs come home american public pretty much issues oil embargoes grain sales  sort thing
would willing - risk oil embargo order promote human rights location location location  withhold arms location location purpose
uh - uh - think - matter fact  've perhaps answered final part  would withhold grain location location order promote civil rights - serviette union
mr
carter  would never single food trade embargo item
ever decided impose embargo crisis international relationships  would include shipments equipment
instance  arab countries ever declare embargo nation oil would consider military economic declaration war  would respond instantly kind
would ship arab country anything - weapons  spare parts weapons  oil-drilling rigs  oil pipe  nothing
wouldn ' single food
another thing 'd like say  international trade  said op - opening statement  become arms merchant world
republican administration came office shipping $ number billion worth arms overseas  ten twelve billion dollar worth arms overseas countries quite often use weapons fight
shift emphasis disturbing  speaking middle east
last democratic administration number percent weapons went middle east location
nowadays - number percent location
number percent go arab countries  include location
include location  present shipment weapons middle east  number percent goes location
deviation idealism ; 's deviation commitment major ally middle east  israel ; 's yielding economic pressure part arabs oil issue ; 's also tremendous indication ford administration addressed energy policy adequately
still comprehensive energy policy country
's overall sign weakness
weak home economically - high unemployment  high inflation  confused government  wasteful defense establishment  encourages kind pressure 's put us successfully
would 've inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago  us brought knees arab oil embargo
done three years ago 're still putting pressure us arab countries discredit around world
weaknesses see  believe 's matter idealism
's matter tough
's matter strong
's matter consistent
priorities ought first meet military needs  secondly meet needs allies friends  ship military equipment foreign countries
matter fact  location gon na get eighty f-numbers even meet air force orders f-lnumbers
shipment spruance-class destroyers location much highly sophisticated spruance-class destroyers present delivered navy
ridiculous ought changed
mr
trewhitt  governor  let pursue may
understand correctly would fact use examples  withhold arms location location location even risk oil embargo securing arms somewhere else  embargo came  'd respond kind
correctly
mr
carter  - location arab country  know  moslem country - location location declare oil embargo us  would consider economic declaration war
would make sure uh - saudis understood ahead time would doubt mind
think circumstances would refrain pushing us knees number previous oil embargo
ms
frederick  president person
mr
ford  governor carter uh - apparently doesn ' realize since 've president sold israelis $ number billion military hardware
made available israelis number percent total economic military aid since establishment israel twenty-seven years ago

time  put limitation thirteen hundred twenty mirvs
technicians working since time location  trying put technical language - agreement verified parties
meantime  developed problem soviet backfire - high-performance aircraft say long-range aircraft people say intercontinental aircraft
interim  development part primarily  cruise missiles ; cruise missiles could launched land-based mobile installations ; cruise missiles could launched - launched high-performance aircraft  like b-numbers b-numbers  hope proceed ; cruise missiles could launched either surface submarine uh - naval vessels
gray-area weapons systems creating problems - agreement salt ii negotiation

new weapons system great potential  conventional nuclear armed
time  make certain location location 's backfire  claim intercontinental aircraft people contend  must also included get kind agreement best interest countries
