thinking earlier post  want clarify many practicing catholics can not accept person person 's strange rationalization voting support pro-abortion candidate
'll try move away specific issue current presidential candidates  'm writing separate post
person offers formulation used often catholics voting candidates  issues cconomic fairness appear catholic catechism  although general terms
teachings prescribe certainty policy catholic un-catholic
paragraphs number  number  number emphasize need action catholics reduce sinful inequalities rich poor  generally casts rather stark terms  little resemblance quality life deemed poor us  furthermore  catechism talks mostly personal work resolve sinful inequalities  establishment government mandate operates redistributionist policy
person doesn ' forbid  either  's really point
parties want help americans live well  different philosophies get
voters general support candidate best represents approach issues  nothing catholicism
neither location war
organization disagreed  war violate catholic doctrine ( para number )
catechism explicitly call indiscriminate destruction whole cities vast areas violation doctrine  us engaged kind warfare decades  ever without substantial provocation ( para number )
even applicable context  since war location  candidates support expansion war location
voters rely something catholic teachings cast vote
however  pointed earlier  doctrine abortion leaves room subjective application values
paragraph number plainly casts every procured abortion moral evil  reinforces stating plainly teaching irrevocable
paragraph number calls formal cooperation abortion grave offense  meaning mortal sin
