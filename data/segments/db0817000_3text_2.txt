considering zeitgeist around `` identity politics `` ( pejorative term wish could find alternative ) may election democrats make point reach swing voters aren ' socially conservative concerned things like constitution  civil liberties  woman 's right choose etc
far better fit democrats social conservatives always going deep moral objection gay women 's rights
( 's pretty much defines social conservative   )
person person ways mostly boys straight talk express want buddy portray prism
gets whatever wants
said  may social conservative neither care social issues
's meat 'll give issues far right stay good graces gets elected
hope person 's team takes good hard look numbers decides veer away usual blurring lines issue makes play independent republican women instead
's right thing  's good politics
