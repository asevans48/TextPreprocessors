ruffini calls groundswell  shouldn ' difficult
obviously good idea assumed person already named
party didn ' see person person catastrophe coming four years away
assume nothing
charismatic young politician  keynote springboard national fame 've seen movie ends happily ( thus far )
exit question  anyone think no-brainer
update  surprising grumbling comments history exorcism vote creationism
update  use keynote either promote new political talent showcase dynamic speaker use time sell party 's message ahead election (  case someone like obama  )
person fits bill first point  much pains say  best second probably huckabee
's popular enough within party get slot  likelihood  's better communicator right moment 'd sop evangelicals miffed fact 's left ticket
worth considering
