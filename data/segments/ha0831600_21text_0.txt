past seven-plus years  left suffered bush derangement syndrome
well  actually  rest us suffered embrace bds  one might think would inoculate us related maladies
jake tapper notes  though  onset person derangement syndrome might prove wrong  broun refers portion speech person gave july location
media dropped two sentences reporting speech  set critics world net daily reported  time  person 's supporters claimed meant peace corps volunteer organizations
seems stretch  broun 's interpretation
wrote time  nation already number non-military national security forces  including organization  ice  border patrol
want fund better  many conservatives would agree  funding extent military
context person 's remarks  though  fairly clearly meant least include volunteer force outreach within outside us sort department peace-like indirect boost national security
nothing speech hints gestapo-like organization
'd agree remain vigilant times ensure government doesn ' try impose regime upon us  extremely thin reed grasp conclusion
although supported freer hand organization monitoring communications one end us possible terrorist activities given dangers face era  's far easier government turn gestapo person proposed
's understood left 's opposition ( well small minority conservatives ) thought reasonable safeguards potential abuse appropriate  eventual compromise congress provided
plan offer rational alternative coming debacle next two years  'd better stick facts eschew hyperbole
need oppose reality radical agenda proposed person democratic majorities congress  fantasies spun context-free snippets speeches
critics invoke person stalin instead person person person person  better reality person  reid  person seem numberaddendum  also  please get rid canard
wasn '
person never elected office
person became chancellor deal struck political factions warring twilight location location  appointed position president person person
nazis never even won majority reichstag  fact lost seats last free elections person became chancellor
unlike parliamentary systems  executive location need hold seat reichstag
location system never support german people  reversion strong-man rule almost inevitable
unlike location  get free elections two years
want win majorities back  'll need stop invoking nazis every turn
update  'm going add rather reposting every number comments thread
nothing post says refrain criticizing person
'm arguing stick facts rather screeching historically inaccurate references person every time disagree person
one credibility left give impulse act like kos kiddies next two years
