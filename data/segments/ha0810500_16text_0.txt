three presidential candidates agree one policy change bush administration makes exit number  close detention center location location
however  three another common quality new policy  ' explain
bringing terrorists misc territory may mean releasing  unless congress wants allow indeterminate detention without trial us  always hidden problem behind rhetoric
closing gitmo takes effort  's beginning organization reveals real issue never guantanamo bay
real issue  one three presidential candidates avoided  whether release known terrorists allow opportunity attack us
closing gitmo  two choices
one would ship detainees another detention facility outside us  would geographical change
would win us nothing terms international approval  would likely much less secure gitmo
second choice would bring detainees us either use civilian courts get congress approve indeterminate detention without trial inside us essentially recognizing danger terrorists pose treating like treat gitmo  using military tribunals instead courts
would change location  hardly salutary one americans
moving detainees back us forces us back law-enforcement model
gives terrorists access civil justice system never applied location 's enemies time war
would force courts treat soldiers policemen terrorists captured battles location lands bank robbers person rights almost certainly get read capture
information identifies dangerous nature would admissible civilian courts  war use methods operate outside restrictions entire national history
words  closing gitmo little point unless purpose free terrorists strike us
's unfortunate consensus found among remaining presidential candidates policy
