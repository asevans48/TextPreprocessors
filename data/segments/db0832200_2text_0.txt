judging gasbags today  right actually accepted chapter number result catastrophic national economic consequences
likely support kind bailout
negotiating point breaking unions
think person person probably set parameters column last week
democrats  unions executives equally responsible problem punishment  democrats vilified  executives take golden parachutes spend time vacation homes landing new jobs unions punished ceasing exist leaving members fend terrible economy
's really fault big three failing  right
person
's person g whether fat  lazy  spoiled union members really less productive  've written  'm  wingnuts really need put end irresponsible bullshit  pronto
repeat  unions cause lower productivity
latest conservative lie person person (  last heard  `` suspended `` person campaign peddling sleazy  racially charged anti-obama video )
recent post `` card check  `` aka employee free choice act ( proposed law make easier organize union - - see )  location wrote  unions lackies democratic party intent path destroy productivity significant period time
um  hardly
even didn ' know economic literature says topic  stop consider postwar era saw record high union density country well unprecedented economic growth productivity gains  might give pause
indeed  person made argument recently
actually  good studies looking impact unions productivity
overall  empirical findings mixed
many studies show positive impact productivity show negative impact  case effects found tend small
example  economist person person person  survey literature topic ( 's chapter number excellent book )  recently wrote `` [ ] empirical evidence allow one infer precise estimate average union productivity effect  assessment existing evidence average union effect close zero  likely somewhat negative somewhat positive  ``
big scheme things  think agree well paid  secure employees make stable society
problem big three far less employees management - - - capitalistic ethos requires myopic obsession quarterly profits long term investment
union members make cars 're told make
's fault americans insisted buying behemoth gas guzzlers auto executives insisted giving knowing full well day reckoning coming
