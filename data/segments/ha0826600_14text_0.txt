associated press postulates today person person may six-point handicap presidential polling due african heritage
based polling  determine white americans negative attitude towards blacks  also negative attitude towards whites  democrats immune
location  polling misses details  person 's win primaries  'm going discount hand
conventional wisdom would wash number people voting person race would roughly offset voting expressly primarily reason
voters exist  examples latter found media
person person openly expressed support person message send transcendence american history obama 's victory would represent  's media analyst make case
person  idea cancel best guess  polling issue would instructive
'm certain ap/yahoo poll satisfies  however
first  methodology seems rather suspect
ask several questions attitudes hardly seems predictive voting patterns  numbers show
attitudes ' change age-demographic basis  person 's support clearly strongest among misc voters
depended less racism  support demographics would make sense ( poll bad job identifying racism )
two-thirds democrats note two negative attitudes towards blacks plan vote person  making supposed racism non-factor
fortunately  solid evidence hand
first  person beat hillary person  especially caucuses  enthusiasm counts much normal primaries
given ap/yahoo findings polling  person never beaten better-organized well-known hillary
second  person almost resum job
last time major party nominated first-term senator executive military experience presidential nominee
person 's ethnicity may reason democrats nominated real questions experience  certainly didn ' appear handicap  either
still could correct conclusions  need much better evidence show
