worked several years retail two decades retail-related security  intention participating longest  roughest day american shopping
years  never heard story like  though  indicates people lost minds humanity sake discounts ( via person )  've seen people get shoving matches fistfights  've heard injuries  death miscarriage
didn ' happen fire erupting terrorist/hostage situation  seen location
hundreds people trampled others death could get cheap retail goods fastest misc presumably celebrate birth jesus christ
point  horrible irony cause people pause think motivates holiday season
everyone likes good deal  us would choose die one therefore shouldn ' want kill one  either
retailers won ' like hear  maybe need spend little less recover humanity little
