regarding debacle wall street  wish someone would explain clearly difference deregulation oversight  person wanted  government control without oversight  democrats succeeded  fact led us financial woes face today
problem wall street wasn ' deregulation
instead  problem much regulation -  government started telling banks loan money
instructions required loans went banks ' financial interests  banks started funny-money stuff protect - organization organization organization organization active participation
democratic side
none would happened oversight
oversight doesn ' mean telling wall street  means policing wall street make sure  makes business decisions  honestly
obama/biden want increase much government dictates wall street  've seen disaster
person want get government bossing wall street around  get government natural appropriate role policing wall street
two concepts hugely different  nobody 's articulating difference  including person person  person biden getting away conflating terms  muddying waters  besmirching person 's reputation foresight
