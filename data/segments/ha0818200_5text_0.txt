remember person horn
's free man  afternoon
didn ' follow case last year debate raging  person gripping account particulars
phone number  shotgun hand  watching two burglars person neighbor 's house broad daylight ; operator told stay put cops way  horn replied couldn ' let get away couldn ' sure wouldn ' make move house next
went outside  caught coming neighbor 's house  told stop  didn ' shot dead  back  although per chronicle link one suspects ran towards veering away  ended hit behind
legal justification supposedly castle doctrine  subset texas 's self-defense law lets defend property firing unlawful intruder without retreat first
spent past hour poring statutes giving migraine  seems two gray areas  one  whether horn thought defending home  neighbor 's home  shootings occurred  two  whether right stand ground ( ie
retreat ) entitles precipitate confrontation could avoided simply anything
sections authorize defense property ( numbernumber numbernumber ) allow deadly force nighttime case burglary  presumably 's harder tell burglar 's packing dim light also burglar 's coming window hour knows people likely home likely bolder  dangerous burglar
horn shootings happened broad daylight
means 's hook  grounds protecting  property  confrontation burglars
per section numbernumber  deadly force used immediately necessary save murdered and/or robbed
's arguably reasonable horn 's case ( although 's word producing weapon )  stayed house avoided entirely
enter subsection ( c )  's stand ground provision
justifies leaving house face  's much exemption duty retreat affirmative right advance
deadly force immediately necessary could prevented sitting tight
's got shotgun 's watching ; try come house  'll never know hit
eh  whatever
's worth parsing statutes finely since ultimately 's ( grand ) jury 's hands 're going send old man jail shooting two felons caught act  whatever felony time day
