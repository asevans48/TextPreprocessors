tough decision  would say students allowed carry concealed firearms campus
let qualify saying strongly support second amendment right bear arms
case  however  many potential problems warrant policy enacted
first  people simply lack proper training carry weapons
would inevitably people would show shiny new pistols  someone would get hurt
many people expert marksmen
firefight ensued  'd wager individual would `` go rambo `` start shooting everything sight
stress shot would relegate people 's training scrapheap  making dangerous
firefight  one must make split-second decision acquire fire
stress might cause people shoot wrong person
issue possessing weapon might actually turn someone target
weapon might make someone feel invincible heroic
may stand ground hopes `` saving day  `` instead retreating might make sense
definitely increases likelihood attacker focusing individual pointing weapon him/her  killing
probably worst thing allowing concealed weapons campus double-edged sword
like someone carry defense  someone else carry offensive purposes !
concealed carry could actually make easier get weapon campus order carry massacre
guess thing concerns line reasoning isn ' hard sneak weapon college campuses begin


still  think allowing concealed carry college campuses bad idea
