foolin '
outrage raise four legislators already facing recall petitions requests number petition packets processed secretary state
's purely symbolic  either  location blogosphere  least  means business
whether think 's overblown  display public might civic accountability 's darned impressive
'm sitting wondering even great amnesty backlash number succeeded intimidating anyone publicly supported bill vote opposing
brownback switched vote literally last minute  knew sure bill defeated
person also reversed  weeks anger really started mount  recall  probably done principle
oh  recall thanks reversal  got f-bomb dropped nominee
incidentally  according location blogger legewatch  ploy decline raises ploy
statutorily  's late
person  's still promising won ' veto pay raise  's worried vetoing jeopardize agenda making enemy legislature  shouldn ' much worry anymore legislature begging get hook
seems like moment calls bold  populist leadership
oof
