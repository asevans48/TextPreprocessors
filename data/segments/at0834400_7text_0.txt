following years warnings melting ice magnify global warming  perhaps irreversible `` tipping point  `` scientists crediting melting ice slowing process
really
remember furor trapped carbon methane arctic permafrost released atmosphere planet warmed
back number  person person reported findings nature study subject characteristically composed words  `` new research raising concerns global warming may triggering self-perpetuating climate time bomb trapped once-frozen permafrost  ``
yikes !
last week  person person 's person person borrowed quote organization 's uber-alarmist  person person  article title - - point return arctic climate
mrasek repeated alarmist warning `` irreversible developments eco-systems humanity  `` brought cycle disappearing arctic ice would  `` magnify global warming  due fact bright white ice reflects sunlight back atmosphere whereas dark colored land ocean absorbs heat  ``
nasty trapped greenhouse gases loss solar radiation reflection  melting ice bad thing  right
well  always
appears something frozen antarctic ice - - iron minerals ferrihydrite schwertmannite - - might actually serve remove atmospheric carbon
person person guardian wrote number melting ice `` would release vast stocks carbon atmosphere  threaten ocean currents wreck roads buildings `` suggests sunday article title melting ice may slow global warming
person relates findings university organization geologist person person  believes dislodged minerals would vastly increase number conumber gobbling photosynthetic plankton  `` melting antarctic icebergs already deposit number tonnes ' bioavailable ' iron southern ocean year  enough grow sufficient plankton remove numbernumber billion tonnes carbon dioxide  equivalent annual carbon pollution location location  ``
apparently ignoring actual slight increase antarctic sea ice extent since number  professor asserts `` rising temperatures cause ice sheets break faster  creating icebergs  amount carbon dioxide removed also rise  ``
global warming cause global cooling  'll instead call `` climate change  ``
shifts natural climate events pacific decadal oscillation  meridional overturning circulation el nino/la person phenomena explain periods cooling  warming
ditto  solar cycles
melting ice trigger cataclysmic cycles doom planet getting warmer  also take heat things cooled late
heads - - alarmists win
tails - - reason loses
simply unbelievable
hat tip  person person
