've lived location number years  one thing people get expert hurry snow traffic
area snow abatement science  use tools disposal
' turn noses road salt  therefore make driving safer twin cities
location apparently priorities ( via person )  leave hard-packed surface
location abandoned use salt clear snow
' want salt water running puget sound
's apparently harmful environment 're willing sacrifice drivers instead
's use salt  even enviro-friendly location
snow gets packed onto roads  turns ice underneath  even best tires ' find purchase
salt lowers freezing temperature water  allowing ice break apart snow plows pull road
gravel also helps  gravel ice doesn ' provide nearly enough traction
drive snow-packed roads winter long plows haven ' made road yet
's fun  even full-wheel drive vehicle like mine  spinouts inevitable
location discovered thing  'm sorry  's ludicrous
many accidents might avoided seattle used well-tested available snow abatement processes included salt
instead begging people stay home  maybe officials stop trading safety citizens opportunity pat back environmental sensitivity
