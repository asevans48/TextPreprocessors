favorite liberal asserts morning wins could put person person striking distance person
let 's define striking distance
according cnn 's count  person leads number-number   exclude superdelegates  number-number  difference number
number delegates stake two states ; hillary wins number/number  delegates split roughly number/number  difference number won ' even get within double digits person among pledged delegates
bear mind latest person poll doesn ' give number/number lead location  doesn ' give lead  number/number  number % undecided
location 's likely end near-wash  location providing number extra delegates
obama 's track blow tomorrow night location even number offset
location location really
winning strengthens case win big states person ' 's already won enough doesn ' need two cement point
expected  problems ballots vote-counting lawsuits  winning makes look much less legitimate ahead convention
noted  moral case superdels nominee isn ' much greater since 'll still trail far behind pledged delegates
's accomplished victories make task wooing superdels ( even pledged delegates  per answer first question ) marginally easier reducing number 'll need convince clinch nomination
've always assumed party bigwigs broker kind deal among undecided superdelegates vote en masse one candidate another especially since bulk organization apparatchiks even marginal improvement isn ' hugely significant
's big deal two states
case campaign grasping straw find  imagining hillary wins location !
headlines going turn whole race around
update  commenters agree 's popular vote
update  commenters ahead game
verrrrry interesting
