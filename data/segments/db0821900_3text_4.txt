son spoke sos 's office  asking gop organization head  person person
oddly enough  available
person manage get election board  independence  location  police officers entered precinct doors
one last things person heard say election board `` ' get signatures
``
son grabbed arms escorted outside
two policemen escorted us soon joined four others two squad cars
surrounded  peppered questions
basically type  `` bothering people  ``
answer  clear could make  `` aren ' bothering !
simply trying vote  people breaking location state statutes  preventing us voting  ``
police responded  `` look  breaking rules
' get  going arrest ! ``
question response  `` rules
rules
employees election board  mandate election board  sos
aren ' concerned breaking state laws  ``
turns  apparently
guy obviously testing limits system  end merited arrest
actually knew rules
elections process extremely fragile ruled local boards pollworkers aren ' always possession facts
add top institutional barriers voting  long lines poor misc precincts  devious tricks beyond id laws  like voter caging  etc
person campaign major task ahead
won ' show poll projection  getting front election protection absolutely worth point two
urge lawyer reading pitch
