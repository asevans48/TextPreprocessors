rather point obvious person hasn ' called hundred-years war location security arrangement still employ decades world war ii korean war person person consults ubiquitous organization organization analysts double person 's distortion  course  person addressed issue appearance obama draws hundred-years war distortion
person clearly said staying region indefinite period americans killed injured combat  location location  give one concerns
said us prevail militarily  would certainly change calculations  favor endless combat operations without hope victory
person also allows bacevich bit historical fudge well without challenge
bacevich claims analogy location person isn ' reliable location location recognizable nation-states  location isn '
