year topic arises  time glamour 's political columnist/blogger person person asks question
boys get attention
carpenter missed important name  one fits m theme  person person
boss owns hot air well eponymous blog

neither blog makes person person 's list must-read sites  mean person sexist rest blogosphere making free-market decision read blogs likes
cassy fiano  successful political blogger  makes point  gets heart matter
angst handwringing cassy derides bean-counting misses point entirely
issue isn ' number women blogosphere  's aren ' barriers entry market gender ethnicity
given ubiquitous nature internet access  economic barriers  either
women freely enter market choose
men women political blogging
