two articles last week indicate far attitudes education shifted away something students work toward birthright  entitlement
somewhat paradoxically  education often portrayed something imposed upon student ; student passive object transitive verb `` educate ``
first example comes person foundation public education 's study graduation rates among student racial sub-populations
according ednews  study `` documents states districts large black enrollments educate white  non-hispanic children  similarly educate majority black male students  ``
executive summary report cites various bits statistical evidence claims represent `` school-age population substantively denied opportunity learn ``
nowhere executive summary student parent attitudes concerning value importance education mentioned
neither social cultural factors - massive single parenthood  gangster/thug culture  etc
important notice phrase `` [ black ] school-age population substantively denied opportunity learn `` turns potential learners objects acted upon  manipulated
schools must educate
wording would reader believe  potential learners  ought passive
far passive  ought
real question way potential learner move  toward away opportunity
second example regards federal court ruling
according austin-american statesman  `` us district judge person person justice said texas education agency violating civil rights spanish-speaking students federal equal education opportunity act  ``
suit brought advocacy groups  led misc american legal defense educational fund
judge justice 's reasoning simple  state location teaching english language learners ( ell ) effectively  state mandated monitoring students `` arbitrary ``
person wrote  `` clear failure secondary lep [ limited english proficiency ] students unquestionably demonstrates  despite efforts  tea [ texas education agency ] met obligation remedy language deficiencies texas students
quarter century sputtering implementation  defendants failed achieve results demonstrate overcoming language barriers secondary lep students  ``
( emphasis added  )
notice  first example  student casted object judge justice 's statement
student must barriers overcome ; state must heavy lifting
attitude takes account student desire - even willingness - learn english
despite fact many lep spanish-speaking students function daily life outside school without knowledge english language
yet judge justice ruled state various independent school districts must overcome language barriers
neither person foundation 's study judge justice 's ruling much  anything  help student populations supposedly seek help
demand equality outcome without casting students positive  active  ultimately controlling role
mean controlling positive sense
every student  regardless socio-economic cultural background (  indeed  mental capacity ) achieve
equal opportunity educational success can not truly guaranteed  approximated
true educators must take advantage every teachable moment  infinitely important student take advantage
education teacher state ; student
would rhetorically make student object acted upon actually damage student 's potential success
