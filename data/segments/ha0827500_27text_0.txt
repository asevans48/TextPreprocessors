time  feared would take two three years rebuild astronomical cost
governor person person announced wanted rebuilt within number months collapse  many scoffed  would force construction brutal winter months
end  pawlenty guessed incorrectly
took less number months rebuild bridge
new st
anthony bridge reopened traffic two weeks ago  popular mechanics looks five lessons new era infrastructure design maintenance
however  also acknowledge sixth lesson  without five would little meaning ( via instapundit )  primary lesson st
anthony bridge rebuild
private enterprise works
road bridge construction location gets performed state agencies subcontract bits pieces retaining general-contractor role
case  bridge replacement badly needed location dumped model use one would produce bridge shorter period time incentivized contractor get done fast
model worked location northridge earthquage destroyed damaged vital freeway overpasses
traffic  bad enough location location even overpasses existed  snarled badly without vital corridors
organization would taken years rebuild repair
instead  state suspended normal laws put contract bid  incentivized speed
work done within months  lower cost least quality caltrans work  better
private enterprise works
businesses understand
need project work done  especially projects speed essential work outside scope expertise  hire contractors rather hire expertise onto payrolls
contractors fall behind penalized even replaced without worry employment law administrative headaches
also get bonuses without invoking kinds payroll issues
popular mechanics outlines fascinating breakthroughs st
anthony bridge design get emulated next generation infrastructure led lighting  pollution-eating crystals  less labor-intensive concrete
sure read fascinating analysis
person  really want bolster misc infrastructure next generation  need states learn primary lesson project  private enterprise works best  delivers quickly
update  comparison lessons big dig
hint  big government approach fails fails badly
