something completely differentby tristeronow cool  team organization scientists reported wednesday science journal nature designed simple circuit element believe enable tiny powerful computers could imitate biological functions
device  called memristor  could make possible build extremely dense computer memory chips use far less power today 's dram memory chips  rapidly reaching limit much smaller made
memristor  electrical resistor memory properties  may also make possible fashion advanced logic circuits  like class reprogrammable chips known field programmable gate arrays  today widely used rapid prototyping new circuits custom-made chips need manufactured quickly
potentially even tantalizing memristors ' ability store retrieve vast array intermediate values  binary numbers numbers conventional chips
makes function like biological synapses  would ideal many artificial intelligence applications ranging machine vision understanding speech
