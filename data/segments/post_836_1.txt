suddenly car pulls front  startled naturally turn around shoot
one behind  innocent dead driver front
simple `` accidents `` like account deaths
something less likely kill person  taser  much safer
people may argue doesnt enough damage defend somone  taserd stop muscles moving  stopping whoever right tracks  alive
stop using guns defense like  nothing deadly self conscious
