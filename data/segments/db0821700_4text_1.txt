yesterday someone wrote comment post talk left ( seems disappeared ) saying inappropriately seeing race theory american politics outgrowth civil war divide
's true - - - except inappropriate part
person first black candidate real shot winning
isn ' relevant theory misc civil war tribes  ' know possibly could
someone said day person person run president would won heartbeat  suggesting race isn ' factor anymore
say 's like person person going location thing - - - person person run  would run republican means wouldn ' race baited republicans
's heart issue
's tribal race one ( perhaps important ) defining issues divide
fact likely black president obviously shows incredible progress
'm sure right thinking americans proud fact  even ' like obama reasons (  's liberal  effete  gay snob  like democrats  )
considering history  's lot special baggage attached candidate  still quite burdensome
republicans naturally everything make sure get much possible tied around neck without leaving fingerprints
's  're damned good
