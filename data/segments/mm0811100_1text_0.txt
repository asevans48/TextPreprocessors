noticed yesterday person person  former democratic senator location current president ou  joined person person endorsing person
thought odd  person known fairly conservative democrat  one probably much common hillary obama well right
mean  guy actual executive experience running university ( pretty well  hear ) foreign policy experience senate intelligence committee  guy heartland state  guy 's everything person isn ' twhy would endorse obama ' ssodifferent right little bell started going
endorsement smart play person  would great ticket-balancer person
offset almost person 's weaknesses  could make inroads red states
' think person wants hillary ticket anywhere close power around ( would  )
edwards doesn ' really like obamessiah much
kos diarist doesn ' like person  person person calls horrible domestic issues
've also doubt liberals would fall line vote judas iscariot vp  long person 's name top ticket
whether person person swallow ideology bring boardthat 's another interesting question
idle speculation
absolutely
