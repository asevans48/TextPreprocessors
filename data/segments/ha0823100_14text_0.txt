taegan person wants try
's clip saddleback
goddard  seems
true enough  believe every vote democrat republican confirm opposing party 's nominee tantamount saying 'd nominated person
( note  person confirmed number-number  )

entirely different unlimited possibilities president choosing nominee best candidate find
guess person 's benefit  go
beyond dopey gotcha  though  lies serious point
actually like fact person voted confirm person breyer  use either vote obviously based legal qualifications  ideological litmus test
conservatives suffered grievously politicization confirmation process ( point made earlier post ) worse congress turns deeper blue
clean hands regard gives president person moral leverage senate vis-a-vis nominees political leverage person right proof true bipartisan pol person person busy voting someone ostentatiously qualified person person
understand campaign isn ' making bigger deal votes  base comes around ( easier post-saddleback ) venture limb mentioning
provided 're carefully qualified  course
