person person invaluable site jihad watch followed post yesterday new york times op-ed piece pw
singer person person recommending west stop using term jihad
day travel  person responds singer noor  reasserting arguments state department directive
singer noor predicate belief term hijacked radicals  person argues radical use exactly organization always interpreted islam  usual  person makes compelling argument
aren ' going change minds meaning term jihad basis state department memo american ad campaign  either
see term jihad meaning holy war infidels  moral-relativist approach won ' convince means internal struggle holiness  pretending terrorists ' believe quest holy
fair enough
still see singer noor mean well
use organization describe acts  sounds 're recognizing attacks part holy war  put another way  accept construct terrorists
perhaps would helpful argue ' accept war holy  especially people target non-combatants ( estimation  least )
regardless define organization  terrorists sympathizers hear us essentially endorsing holy nature fight
end  won ' make much difference whether stop using term
's interesting academic exercise
instead  person implores  state focusing important steps take radical islam  fact  might good way confront location well establishing communication misc people ways allow hear see information government denies
