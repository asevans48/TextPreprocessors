remember mutual ; verifiable challenge challenge met  testing resume  would continue testing well
vanocur  last series questions foreign affairs mr
boyd
boyd  congresswoman person  little experience military matters yet might someday find commander-in-chief armed forces
convince american people potential enemy would know protect nation 's security  think way soviets might tempted try take advantage simply woman
ferraro  saying would fought war order love peace
boyd  'm saying  'm asking - know asked
person  right
think happens try equate whether military experience  's natural conclusion
's valid saying would black order despise racism  'd female order terribly offended sexism
's
think take look 've  congress intend go  type person - think people country rely upon fact lender
' think soviet union one minute sit make determination 'm ever position something reference location location
quite frankly 'm prepared whatever necessary order secure country make sure security maintained
secondly  soviet union ever believe could challenge location location sort nuclear forces otherwise  position leadership country  would assured would met swift  concise certain retaliation
let say one thing
important thing  though think leader one get point 're put position
way position rnoving away make decision - armed force anything else - moving toward arms control
's 's done past four years
think take look failures administration would number one
put position leader country
move immediately toward arms control negotiations
boyd  follow  'm going borrow leaf sunday night debate principals ask single question would like ask opponent foreign policy
ferraro  oh  ' single-most question
guess concern concern vice-presidential candidate citizen country
concern anything stop arms race  seems keep talking military inferiority -  comparable level misc union ; joint chiefs staff said 'd never exchange military power
guess thing 'd want commitment pretty soon 're going something making safer world us
boyd  vice-president person  four years ago president person insisted military buildup would bring soviets negotiate seriously
since  spent almost trillion dollar defense soviets still building military forces rapidly  negotiations
president 's original premise  whole strategy  wrong
bush   think strategy correct correct
've got go back
clearly  came office  american people recognized slipped positions inferiority various things
planes  president points  older pilots ; ships couldn ' go sea
major problem military
actually  morale wasn ' good either
strengthen military 're well way getting job done
location back terms military strength  terms ability deter aggression keep peace
time  however  made proposals proposals proposals - sound proposals - reducing nuclear weapons
strategic arms reduction talks good proposals  's soviets left table
intermediate nuclear force talks sound talks  wish location location continued
chemical weapon treaty ban chemical weapons  initiative  soviets
wish would think anew move forward verification everybody would know whether side keeping word
much important  'd reduce level terror
similarly  're reducing - trying talk  talking  location  conventional force reduction
've talked human rights
've met mr
person mr
person  mention try something human rights question
suppression soviet jews absolutely intolerable keep pushing forward moral grounds well arms reduction ground
view president strong  've addressed imbalances - think 're close getting job done - soviets likely make deal
organization made abm treaty felt going deploy abm system
optimistic future  realize strong  principled president negotiate  strong leadership  yet demonstrable flexibility arms control
boyd   'll give chance  mr

let put way - ' questions  different - reagan-bush administration different carter-mondale [ sic ] administration american people going clearest choice
's question going back failed ideas past  came - number % percent interest rates  inflation  despair  malaise  leadership  blaming american people failed leadership
another option - keep recovery going benefits absolutely everybody
peace home - peace abroad - prosperity - opportunity
'd like hear talk things  think yellow light flashing 'll leave
