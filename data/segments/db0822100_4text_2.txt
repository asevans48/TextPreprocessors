hate mean
idea `` team rivals `` common enough organizational principle
executives like results come creative competition among underlings
politics another dimension  course - - - co-opting neutralizing enemies  old `` keep friends close enemies closer `` thing

term `` bipartisanship `` accurately refers legislative coalitions compromise 's much different issue - - - particularly one side much better rolling
anyway  trope ever time real bipartisan comity complete myth
even wwii republicans agitated roosevelt - - - person one hated ( loved ) presidents history mythic period american consensus
fact kearns-goodwin trots time civil war less partisan angry today - - - even describes duels assassination attempts cabinet members speaking one another months - - - bizarre
