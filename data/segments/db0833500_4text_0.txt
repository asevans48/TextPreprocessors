yetby digbyhowie person great post today discussing person person republicans ' supposed move moderation
urge read whole analysis
know many people think gop tack back center  perhaps come pass
read  like howie 's  yet long shot
conservatives actually prefer obstruction good
fact  think  's natural place system since claim believe government
's something quite dissonant charge something hate
quite natural party obstruction  far better democrats proved really ' talent
one things 's quite clear battle royale supreme court
already nominal majority  person eccentric enough able completely count
looking someone fill vacancy could potentially souter stevens side - - - someone nominated moderate end comfortable vote side
least try force obama forced person  nominate moderates levels court balance far right radicals republican presidents insist right confirm
( remember  `` consequences `` elections republicans win 's mandate far right agenda democrats win 's mandate moderate bi-partisanship
wttw  )
mentioned couple weeks ago person person throwing gauntlet
looks like person
person writes  times calls person `` genteel `` ( absurd way refer someone kicked army grabbing enlisted man 's private parts ) `` cagey  `` offers hope may turning new leaf
senator person pronouncing president-elect person person good start opportunity tackle big issues middle
heard
yet heartening twist minority leader  newly re-elected race found close comfort  quoting mr
obama make point  retrieving bit prophecy number  democrats despaired minority senator person observed  whoever 's power going govern modesty desire work side aisle
's certainly approach would advise democrats regain control
sounds like person actually saying  though  long person adopts republican policy positions  'll go along
last week promised radical right federalist society would best undermine president person 's judicial nominees
according person `` judicial nominees identified political causes line interests favored groups  including politically correct ones identified person presidential campaign  might able keep oath uphold law  ``
kind think times little naive assessment today
yeah
person raged  person  person 's comment would appoint people `` empathy  ``
seems currency right - - - look join `` tort reform `` `` secret ballot `` huge applause lines
