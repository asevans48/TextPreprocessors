definition everyone bigot  including  probably come group people ' want around
however  closer look definition bigot clearly show possible person want around group people reasons intolerance opinions  lifestyles  identities differing

supposed sitting saying nothing  would still rather something else
btw  think convenient  `` intolerant bigotry can not called bigotry  ``
