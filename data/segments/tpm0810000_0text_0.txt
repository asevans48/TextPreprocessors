yesterday brought roundup senate races  showing democrats poised expand majority chamber
've taken look overall picture house
verdict
less dems poised major gains
democrats number-number house seats real risk
person  gop going defend number-number seats
yesterday  examined ratings compiled non-partisan sources  person person  person person cq
viewed whole  outlook pretty amazing
history taught us party wins `` wave `` election ( dems number ) poised losses two years later  judge dems position expand majority anywhere five number seats
first  year turning generally poor environment republicans whole  even presidential race might end close
recent polling shows president 's approval rating number % even though congress ' rating lower institution  democrats still lead generic congressional ballot ten points
good measurement party confidence number retirements party
many older members might want retire rather struggle powerless minority  relatively younger members might see private law and/or lobbying practices better use time
thanks mostly fact far republicans dems retiring house  eight democratic house seats opened  compared number gop seats
's number % gop 's total party conference
many retirements trigger competitive races  creating new dangers party trying hang onto seats question
indeed  many open gop seats northeastern midwestern districts voted democratic president past gone narrowly republican
republicans also generally poor run luck senate counterparts crucial area candidate recruitment
perception gop continue minority hardly incentive ambitious republicans run win  `` reward `` would serve powerless minority caucus
perhaps best illustrated open seat rep
person person ( r-il )  local mayor person person actually dropped race shortly 'd won republican primary  causing gop seek unknown businessman replacement candidate
location  gop failed last minute recruit conservative democrat switch parties man open democratic-held seat
speaks another problem gop  even deep-red seats held dems could otherwise put play  gop chronically unable recruit candidates take tough assignment swimming overall dem tide
democrats also better shape organizationally financially
recent filings give organization cash-on-hand figure $ number million  compared paltry $ numbernumber million organization
democrats much better-positioned fight across various districts  also entice potential candidates promise support opposite holds true gop
normal dynamic wave election winning party loses seats next time around  dems poised make history fall  thanks favorable playing field  gop opposition unable get act together  strong organizational effort bring bear
question right resounding democrats ' coming defeat conventional wisdom historical precedent
