mr
person  serious problem country  dealt

part requires employers determine citizenship employee 're hired
'm convinced result would people hispanic  people different languages speak accent  would find difficult employed
think 's wrong

counterproductive
support aspects simpson-mazzoli bill strengthen enforcement border  strengthen ways dealing undocumented workers difficult area dealing problem settling people lived many  many years established status

ms
geyer  sir  people well-balanced father person hesburgh notre dame  headed select commission immigration  pointed repeatedly immigration reform without employer sanctions  would unbalanced bill  would simply way enforce
however  putting aside moment  critics also said repeatedly gone along bill immigration reform hispanic groups - - hispanic leadership groups - - actually represent hispanic-americans want  polls show overwhelmingly want kind immigration reform
say  justify position

mr
person  think 're right polls show majority hispanics want bill  'm political reasons
'm life 've fought system justice country  system every american chance achieve fullness life without discrimination

despite politics  stand stand  think 'm right  fight 're going come better bill  effective bill undermine liberties people
ms
geyer  mr
president    said borders control
yet fall allowed simpson-mazzoli bill - - would least minimally protected borders rights citizenship - - relatively unimportant issue reimbursement states legalized aliens
given  may ask priority expect give forgotten national security element
sincere efforts control  effect  nation-state location location
president  georgie person   believe  supported simpson-mazzoli bill strongly - - bill came senate
however  things added house side felt made less good bill ; matter fact  made bad bill
conference - - stayed conference way even senator person want bill manner would come conference committee
number things weakened bill
' go detail
true borders control
also true situation borders back number administrations
supported bill
believe idea amnesty put roots lived even though sometime back may entered illegally
regard employer sanctions  must ensure identify illegal aliens  also  keep protesting would employers  another employer shouldn ' concerned  employers years encouraged illegal entry country hire individuals hire starvation wages none benefits think normal natural workers country  individuals ' complain illegal status
' think people allowed continue operating free
provisions regard sanctions  forth - - 'm going everything  us administration  join congress back get immigration bill give us   control borders
regard friendship border countries  yes  administration know established relationship latin friends
long economy leaves many people dire poverty unemployment  going seek employment across borders

ms
geyer  mr
president  experts also say situation today terribly different quantitatively - - qualitatively different past gigantic population growth
instance  location 's population go number million today number million turn century
many people coming location location citizens  illegal workers
repeatedly said recently believe armageddon  destruction world  may imminent times
ever feel armageddon situation  time anarchy  regarding population explosion world
president
matter fact  population explosion  look actual figures  vastly exaggerated - - exaggerated
matter fact  pretty scientific solid figures much space still world many people
's almost like going back malthusian theory  even saying everyone would starve limited population
problem population growth one   regard immigration
safety valve  whether wanted  illegal entry  location  population increasing ' economy absorb provide jobs
're trying work  protect borders kind fairness recognition problem
mr
newman  mr
person  rebuttal
mr
person  one biggest problems today countries south desperately poor people almost lose lives ' come north  come north despite risks
're going find permanent  fundamental answer  goes american economic trade policies permit nations chance get two feet get prosperity  jobs people
's enormous national debt  engineered administration  harming countries fueling immigration
high interest rates - - real rates doubled administration - - effect location  cost repaying debts enormous results massive unemployment  hardship  heartache
drives friends south region  need end deficits well
mr
newman  mr
president  rebuttal
president  well  rebuttal 've heard national debt blamed lot things  illegal immigration across border - - [ laughter ] - - nothing
regard high interest rates   least give us recognition fact left office  mr
person  number\number/number\ - - prime rate
's number\number/number\  predict 'll coming little shortly
're trying undo things administration
[ applause ] mr
newman  applause  please
mr
person  question president person
armageddon mr
person  mr
president  'd like pick armageddon theme
've quoted saying believe  deep  heading kind biblical armageddon
organization secretary defense plans location location fight prevail nuclear war
feel heading perhaps  kind nuclear armageddon
feel country world could survive kind calamity
president  mr
person  think hailed something 'm supposedly  president  discussing principle recall philosophical discussions people interested things ; prophecies years  biblical prophecies would portend coming armageddon  forth  fact number theologians last decade believed true  prophecies coming together portend
one knows whether armageddon  prophecies mean armageddon thousand years away day tomorrow
never seriously warned said must plan according armageddon
regard say whether would try survive event nuclear war  course would
let also point several parliaments around world  europe asia  made statement one  'll repeat  nuclear war can not won must never fought
maintaining deterrent trying achieve deterrent capacity one would believe could start war escape limited damage
deterrent - - 's - - also led propose called star wars concept  propose research see isn ' defensive weapon could defend incoming missiles
defense could found  wouldn ' far humanitarian say defend nuclear war destroying missiles instead slaughtering millions people
strategic defense initiative mr
person  mr
president  made proposal  so-called star wars proposal  said  'm mistaken  would share super-sophisticated technology location location
distrust years  sir  expressed towards location location  really expect anyone take seriously offer would share best location 's technology weapons area principal adversary
president
- - hope ; 're still researching - - come weapon renders missiles obsolete
never weapon invented history man led defensive  counterweapon
suppose came
people said  `` ah  would make war imminent  would think could launch first strike could defend enemy  '
' offered asked location location
say  `` look  's
'll even give
sit us get rid  us  nuclear weapons free mankind threat  '
' think would greatest use defensive weapon
mr
person  mr
person  've sharply critical president 's strategic defense initiative
yet  wrong major effort country try use best technology knock many incoming nuclear warheads possible
mr
person  first  let sharply disagree president sharing advanced  dangerous  important technology america location location
many years  understandably  system restraints high technology soviets behind us
research development along star wars schemes would inevitably involve advanced computers  advanced engineering
thought would share location location  opinion  total non-starter
would let soviet union get hands
's wrong star wars
's nothing wrong theory
could develop principle would say sides could fire missiles one would get hurt  suppose 's good idea
fact 're far away research even comes close  director engineering research defense department said get would solve eight problems  difficult atomic bomb location project
would cost something like trillion dollar test deploy weapons
second thing assumes soviets wouldn ' respond kind
always
' get behind
won ' get behind
's tragic story arms race
stake space satellites
could stop  right  testing deployment space weapons - - president 's proposals go clear beyond research ; research wouldn ' argument  maybe someday  somebody think something - - commit nation buildup antisatellite space weapons time  crude state  would bring arms race 's dangerous indeed
one final point
dangerous aspect proposal  first time  would delegate computers decision whether start war
's dead wrong
wouldn ' time president decide ; would decided remote computers
might oil fire  might jet exhaust  computer might decide 's missile - - go
' stop madness draw line keep heavens free war
[ applause ] nuclear freeze mr
person  mr
person  general area  sir  arms control  president person 's national security adviser  person person  said  `` nuclear freeze hoax  '
' yet basis arms proposals  understand  mutual verifiable freeze existing weapons systems
view  specific weapons systems could subject mutual verifiable freeze  could
mr
person  every system verifiable placed table negotiations agreement
would agree negotiations agreement involved conduct part soviet union couldn ' verify every day
would agree agreement location location security interest fully recognized supported
's say mutual verifiable freezes
support freeze
ever-rising arms race madness makes nations less secure
's difficult defend nation
's putting hair-trigger nuclear war
administration  going star wars system  going add dangerous new escalation
tough location location  think american people - - - - mr
newman  time  mr
person
mr
person  - - - - people soviet union want stop
mr
newman  president person  rebuttal
president  yes  rebuttal   invention created would go rolling soviet union - -  mr
person  idea would defensive weapon would sit say  ``  willing join us
's ' ' - - give demonstration say - - `` 's
're willing join us getting rid nuclear weapons world  'll give one  would know one cheat ; 're got something anyone tries cheat
