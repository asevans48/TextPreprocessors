tiberius gambitby digbyi received interesting comment today reader  lot ink spilled weeks ago deep divides democratic party ( strategic weren ' fabrications less noticeable  methinks  post-palin  despite gop 's `` hillary voter `` bullshit  )
yet almost notice taken real internal war going within republican party
believe ever direct repudiation incumbent two-term president nominee party one person person administered george bush convention speech
ironically  despite pro forma attempts lay blame `` parties  `` person specific otherwise vague rambling speech cataloged many ills republican rule inflicted nation
unprecedented attempt focus blame predecessor pass little reflection
reporting  even speculation  george bush 's private response brutal public sleight
believe reasons primarily three-fold
one  since media must instantly known person 's claim agent change  given lockstep  pro-bush voting record structure campaign staff  flimsy couldn ' wipe ass  've ignored political policy split bush since know doesn ' really exist
two  person distraction far all-purpose black hole  sucking vestige substance election  one time bush anymore - 's old gop
three  george bush decided get even  rather get mad

'm sitting  looks like bush gotten best - bonus gets say fu
country well using slime machine ensure dreadful policies continued
useful look happened succession power ancient rome made transition republic empire person person
think tiberius gambit
emperor best ensure one followed could never rival achievements
short step indeed tiberius inflict egregious caligula empire  secure knowledge would make populace yearn comparatively golden days rule
augustus gave us tiberius  tiberius gave us caligula accidental claudius gave us nero
nero almost destroyed roman economy personal greed burned part rome intending  perhaps  remove blight quarter congested urban poor
got way hand began feel universal public opprobrium  blamed fringe group alien terrorists  early christians
bush would give us person person would give us person person ignite fire fiddle planet burns
joke us
hail !
sleoncambridge  person always felt person junior 's primary consideration anything point rehabilitating bush legacy
