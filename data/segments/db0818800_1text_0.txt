think 's fair position take
appears saying attorney general opposed abortion rights would fine long doesn ' believe bombing abortion clinics
( 'm sure ashcroft backed bombing abortion clinics  perhaps person reasons opposing
god knows  plenty  )
' agree 's fair position take
confirming attorney general adamantly opposed abortion rights simply agrees issue shouldn ' solved violence seems like pretty low bar
roe settled law
would confirm attorney general believed segregation fine promised fairly administer laws
always remembered abortion became cause de jour right legal segregation lost organizing clout
's part mosaic civil rights  animated certain people right side spectrum beginning
's served  well
abortion debate   conceived political purposes  numbers  order solidify shift divorce abortion  religious right constructed abortion myth  one accepted americans true
simply put  abortion myth  leaders religious right would us believe movement began direct response us supreme court 's number roe person person decision
politically conservative misc leaders morally outraged ruling instantly shed apolitical stupor order mobilize politically defense sanctity life
leaders reluctantly great personal sacrifice  risking obloquy congregants contempt liberals `` secular humanists  `` trying best ruin america
selfless  courageous leaders religious right  inspired opponents slavery nineteenth century  trudged dutifully battle order defend innocent unborn children  newly endangered supreme court 's misguided roe decision
's compelling story  question
except one thing  isn ' true
although various roman catholic groups denounced ruling  christianity today complained roe decision `` runs counter moral teachings christianity ages also moral sense american people  `` vast majority misc leaders said virtually nothing ; many comment actually applauded decision
w person person baptist press wrote  `` religious liberty  human equality justice advanced supreme court abortion decision  ``
indeed  even roe decision  messengers ( delegates ) number southern baptist convention gathering st
louis  location  adopted resolution stated  `` call upon southern baptists work legislation allow possibility abortion conditions rape  incest  clear evidence severe fetal deformity  carefully ascertained evidence likelihood damage emotional  mental  physical health mother  ``
person person  former president southern baptist convention pastor first baptist church location  texas  expressed satisfaction roe person person ruling  ``
always felt child born life separate mother became individual person  `` redoubtable fundamentalist declared  `` always  therefore  seemed best mother future allowed  ``
religious right 's self-portrayal mobilizing response roe decision pervasive among evangelicals questioned
attendance unusual gathering location  dc  finally alerted abortion myth
november number  reasons still ' entirely understand  invited attend conference location sponsored ethics public policy center  religious right organization ( though didn ' realize time )

let 's remember  said animatedly  religious right come together response roe decision
person insisted  got us going political movement attempt part internal revenue service ( irs ) rescind tax-exempt status organization organization organization racially discriminatory policies
racial discrimination flowed directly anti-abortion movement
's part thing
luckily  still remains enough common sense pragmatic relationships real life problems among actual citizens country moved far enough criminalize abortion
probably
already see popular culture moving direction
frankly  illegal abortion won ' quite prevalent roe vs wade society changed single motherhood unwed pregnancy aren ' stigmatized
things  like cases cited link  women ' afford kids ' imagine giving one children 's brothers sisters adoption  young girls serious problems lived denial long - - - married woman ill advised affair husband away location
sex  failed birth control  bad judgment  rape  things always part human experience
fact insisting women give birth make unwanted lifelong commitment ( adoption ) cluster cells petrie dish incomplete human lives inside body rights life  liberty pursuit happiness  say women actually fewer claims ideals
doubt person supports roe vs wade never great expectation would champion reproductive rights
politicians around  even so-called liberal variety
'd vastly relieved issue would go away
fallacy  course  thinking wouldn ' immediately supplanted another wedge issue right beat left head
