anderson cooper asked person person last night answer claim person person applicable experience
response  completely ignores person 's status governor  makes claim campaign counts executive experience  let 's take last point first
person person pass legislation bearing recommendations emergency management
list actions taken person wake person compiled supporter doesn ' exactly lend conclusion
one strips speeches  actual legislative actions appear mostly consist adding name co-sponsor bills others  's unclear whether bills person introduce ever passed
even  gives experience managing disasters
governors mayors manage disasters  succeed  save lives
fail  saw location  costs lives
legislators role disaster management  although honestly  disaster management isn ' usually resum point voting mayor  governor  president
whatever impulse exists make one stems irrational blame heaped george bush failures person person person person location  although organization certainly failures well
main point person didn ' really answer question  set straw man argument response cooper
governor person  well  governor  currently mayor wasila
governor  person operates $ number billion budget  manages $ number billion revenue
furthermore  runs government employs number people
person blithely pretends 's still mayor wasilly order boost
however  running office isn ' executive experience  one good reason  person isn ' campaign manager
person ceo actually running campaign  handling budget  managing people person makes speeches
person 's best response experience question  attacks person 's experience stop  unless campaign wants person keep embarrassing making
update  person campaign responded mark halperin time  standard  anyone ever ran public office executive experience also kills experience argument palin anyway
