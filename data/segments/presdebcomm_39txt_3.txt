judge
schieffer  right  let 's go another question
senator person
two minutes  sir
senator  last debate  president person said favor draft
agreed
national guard reserve forces severely strained many held beyond enlistments
say 's back-door draft
relief could offered brave americans families
became president  senator person  would situation holding national guard reservists extended periods time repeated call-ups 're facing
kerry  well  think fact 're facing repeated call-ups  two three deployments  's stop - loss policy prevents people able get time  reflection bad judgment president exercised engaged world deployed forces
military overextended
nine number active-duty army divisions either location  going location come back location
one way  're wrapped
've proposed adding two active-duty divisions armed forces location location - - one combat  one support
addition  'm going double number special forces fight effective war terror  less pressure national guard reserve
would like see national guard reserve deployed differently country
's much respect homeland security
ought
would relieve enormous amount pressure
important thing relieve pressure armed forces frankly run foreign policy recognizes location strongest working real alliances  sharing burdens world working statesmanship highest levels diplomacy bring nations side
've said  say  believe president broke faith american people way took nation war
said would work real alliance
said location would plan carefully  would take every precaution
well  didn '
result forces today overextended
fact choose go war last result
america paying  already $ number billion  $ number billion 're finished much probably
result president taking eye person person person
schieffer  mr
president
bush  best way take pressure troops succeed location  train iraqis hard work democracy  give chance defend country  precisely 're
'll number troops trained end year
