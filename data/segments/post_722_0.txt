' 's sharp logic  hawking
little open minded
consider things   - responsible gun owner would bring weapon keg party
- majority legal gun owners smart people

're going whip guns wave around safety lock
legal gun owners acquired weapons legally training show  psychologically sound individuals ability stay calm level-headed time crisis
- case haven ' noticed  gang members ' bother leveling shooting
run around blindly shooting without looking
wonder innocent people get hit stray bullets
- ever consider many people whose lives saved happened gun
would-be thief going mess 've got gun trained
hear number-year-old woman held gun burglar made call police
could injured killed unarmed
- virginia tech - - student teacher campus gun  might able stop killer
everyone wait number people shot ' help ' arrived
last least  consider numbernd amendment  protects individual 's right gun
case people didn ' know  numbernd amendment integral part constitution
ban weapons 've got millions law-abiding citizens ( aka sitting ducks ) country 's vicious gang members general scum society terrorize government lays thousands laws restrict populace
