somewhat baffling politically stupid self-destructive behavior
plan along give bush everything wanted  obviously  beginning
instead  picked dramatic fight received substantial media attention
exposed freshmen swing-district members attack ads
caused base allies spend substantial energy resources defending attacks
picking fight letting rage weeks  going always - - meekly give president  yet generating tidal wave headlines trumpeting bowed  surrendered  caved  lost president
're going cast appearance engaged battle got crushed  ran away fear fear-mongering ads run attacks president
demoralize base increase contempt base justifiably holds ( 's possible )
's almost though purposely picked path imposed political costs benefits
end day  powerful interest covering original sin  failing speak rampant lawbreaking executive branch first place
first instinct face lawbreaking wonder badly blamed
'd rather bury feign outrage
course  problem exactly person describes ; democrats always derided republicans failing protect america matter cover provide
take stand couple weeks eventual goal going immunize president along
