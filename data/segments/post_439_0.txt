united nations states universal declaration human rights everyone right  among things  medical care
absurd say impoverished people feed family denied health care
equally absurd believe number million people living location location helped `` charity work  ``
millions impoverished americans insurance barely afford also harmed current health care plan
take scenario example  poor vietnamese immigrant develops cough
doesn ' visit doctor believe condition serious  can not afford regular visit doctor
waits waits eventually coughs blood
finally visits doctor finds serious case tb severely damaged body
pay extensive treatment becomes impoverished
government funded insurance program scenario would exist
man would visit doctor free charge
would diagnosed early would receive free preventative medicine
could still feed family
every industrialized country world ( except us ) provides citizens free health care
need wake realize government run insurance program way solve current health care disaster
must put special interests aside help citizens
health care right
disagree disagree organization organization ' location location ' definition universal human rights
