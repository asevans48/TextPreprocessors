thermodynamics
okay  good
physics explain
' explain thermodynamics doesn ' know 's summer winter
melting ice making surrounding air cooler making temperatures drop wintertime ( locations far away )  come melting ice isn ' making locations cooler summertime
ice melting summertime
yes  according satellite data
ice melt cooling surrounding air  shouldn ' lowered air temperature slow melt instead speed
theeco-left usingoccasionally stiflingsummer heat (   never happened global warming started years ago ) evidence global warming  magical far-reaching thermodynamic cooling
must time year thermodynamics summer break
al gore  unfortunately  never break
