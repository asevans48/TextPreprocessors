also cautious way use military
moderator  non-military area influencing events around world  financial economic area  organization organization president person said recently  governor  us contributions overseas development assistance lower almost ever
problem

bush  well  mentioned third world debt
moderator  sure
bush  's place use generosity influence positive way  influence nations
believe ought foreign aid  ' think ought foreign aid sake foreign aid
think foreign aid needs used encourage markets reform

world bank think generally better job  think one big issues doesn ' get nearly enough attention issue corruption
governor mentioned earlier
've worked issue
's enormous problem corruption official agencies  like militaries police departments around world  customs officials  's one worst forms
got lead example help countries trying straighten situations find tools order

worlds coming together  said  're looking us
fundamental choice make
going step plate nation way world war ii  way generation heroes said okay  location location going leader
world benefitted tremendously courage showed post-war years
think aftermath cold war  's time us something similar  step plate  provide leadership environment  leadership make sure world economy keeps moving right direction

moderator  lets move
let 's move
gore  far suggest otherwise
( laughter ) moderator  first  couple follow-ups vice presidential debate last week
vice president person  would support sign  president  federal law banning racial profiling police authorities levels government
gore  yes  would
thing executive order accomplish ban federal law enforcement agencies  would also support law congress would effect thing
- - think racial profiling serious problem
remember stories first came stops new jersey highway patrol
know 's going long time
ways new label something going years
confess first time really focused new way
surprised extent
think 've got many examples around country really find ways end
imagine - - like someone singled unfairly  unjustly  feel unfair force law simply race ethnicity
runs counter location location location core
's easy problem solve
entrusted presidency  first civil rights act numberst century
bush  yeah  ' imagine would like singled race stopped harassed
's flat wrong  's location
ought everything end racial profiling
one concerns  though  ' want federalize local police forces
want - - obviously egregious cases need enforce civil rights law  need make sure internal affairs divisions local level job given chance job
believe local control governments  obviously ' needs consequence federal level
's important overstep bounds think people - - police officers good  dedicated  honorable citizens job  putting lives risk aren ' bigoted aren ' prejudiced
' think ought held guilty
think need find racial profiling occurs something say local folks  get done
'  federal consequence
moderator  could federal law
bush  yeah
moderator  would agree
gore  would agree
also agree police officers  course  good job hate practice also
talked african-american police officer location  location long ago raised question said opinion one biggest solutions training
training police procedures  human relations
think racial profiling part larger issue deal race location
singling people race  know  person person singled race texas
americans singled race ethnicity
's think embody values passing hate crimes law
think crimes different
think 're different 're based prejudice hatred  gives rise crimes single victim  're intended stigmatize dehumanize whole group people
moderator  different view
bush   '  really
moderator  hate crimes laws
bush
've got one texas
guess
three men murdered person person  guess 's going happen
're going put death
jury found guilty
's going hard punish worse get put death
's right cause
's right decision
secondly  forms racial profiling goes location
arab-americans racially profiled called secret evidence
people stopped  something
friend  senator person person location  pushing law make sure arab-americans treated respect
racial profiling isn ' issue local police forces
's issue throughout society
become diverse society  're going deal

're tolerant people
're good  tolerant people

moderator  - - become president  governor  areas  racial problem areas  would deal president involving discrimination
like said  arab-americans  also hispanics  asians  well blacks country
bush  let tell biggest discrimination comes
public education move children schools
friend  person person
one greatest lines lines
said  reading new civil right
's right
make sure society hopeful possibly  every single child location must educated
mean every child
starts making sure every child learns read
k-number diagnostic testing know whether 's deficiency
curriculum works phonics needs integral part reading curriculum
intensive reading laboratories  teacher retraining
mean  needs wholesale effort racial profiling  illiterate children
better public schools
close achievement gap  starts making sure strong accountability  person
one cornerstones reform  good reform  measure
measure ask question  know
anybody profiled
anybody discriminated
becomes tool  corrective tool
believe federal government must say receive money  money federal government disadvantaged children  example  must show us whether children learning
fine
're  consequence
make sure end getting rid basic structural prejudice education
nothing prejudiced educating child
moderator  vice president person  would racial discrimination elimination list president
gore  well  think need tough enforcement civil rights laws
