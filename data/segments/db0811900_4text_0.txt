jeremiah wrightby tristeroif haven ' seen bill moyers ' interview person person  go see parts
encounter remarkable man  highly intelligent  articulate  charismatic - 's easy see someone smart person would find compelling
also encounter someone entirely bereft false modesty - kind
credit  however  wright appeared least genuine insight flaws ( lapses character  whatever want call ) adds considerable attractiveness
striking  frankly refreshing ever seen likes person person speak  wright 's refusal play holier thou
comes across human  somewhat larger life
words  's cheesy plastic replicant fifties fantasy america
man spoke moyers - 's shown long excerpts ( tv  ) sermons - person person person really  rightwing likely committed spectacular blunder trying demonize - extension  person
opportunities given wright reach national audience  harder counteract  let alone brand america-hating black power radical
far 'm concerned  right wants make issue  better
really powerful  positive  presence ( variety reasons  predisposed think exactly opposite )
really shouldn ' need say  anyway  prefaced person person persona showed moyers wright - smart  intellectual  socially active  religious  quick temper sense grandiosity
hardly know anything
saw impressive made want learn
anyone substantive information wright - mere reactions soundbites  utterly misleading - please drop comments
good  bad  indifferent -
update  folks comments opinion wright take vacation  's harming person soundbites
oh
well  maybe say something stupid 'll regret
