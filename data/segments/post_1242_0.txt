children look others different think blame
parents adults society  's
read recently gospel tract put well known right wing christian
showed girl elementary school opposed teacher allowing two gay dentista come school speak class
telling classmates grandfather told gay sickness sin simply assuming correct thing say
overheard mother telling little girl whose name suzy important things
said  `` person  probably encounter people world look people different
suzy  even talk like  must look people different
everybody place world must show respect
want get respect  must show respect  ``
think 's time us adults start acting like suzy 's mother instead girl 's grandfather
go long way changing things better
