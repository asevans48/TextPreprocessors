person eschewed federal financing campaign  entirely beholden supporters money run campaign
thinks raise $ number- $ number millionbetween september order swamp person person 's taxpayer sponsored campaign
goal  $ number million raised junemight net $ number-number million fundraising whales get finished raising portion total
enough
perhaps better question  right strategy
obama spending time days appearing fat cats paying $ number plate hear speak
probably spending lot time phone also  urging big money fundraisers increase efforts
leaves lot less time getting meeting voters
doubt person swings town  disappointed supporters  due size limitations venue  unable get tickets hear person
voters honestly ' know much aren ' learning much since candidate spends much time fundraising mode
come back haunt november
hard say
going money needs advertising
depend huge army volunteers plead cause undecideds - probably better way reach voter anyway
hand  race pivots ridiculously small number states - number number - person tending garden july-august might mean sprout weeds november kill candidacy
pleasant thing contemplate trying squeeze money party whales endless number fundraisers must atend raise money says needs win
surprisingly candidates almost equal cash hand end june ; mccain nearly $ number millionin cash person $ number million
moment  simply isn ' enough advantage justify forgoing federal funds
