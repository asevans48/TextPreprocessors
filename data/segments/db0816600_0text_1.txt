okay  feel better
good !
let 's move
half-life  global warming  family meltdown
first week  variety already beat punch ( damme  sirs ! )
dubbed writer-director person person 's half-life misc beauty  'm going describe sometimes overreaching consistently provocative suburban dramedy ice storm meets person person
audacious mlange melodramatic soap opera  dark comedy  metaphysical conundrum apocalyptic doom  beautifully photographed half-life ambitiously poses causality dilemma old chicken-egg school  came first  dystopian society dysfunctional family
dystopia question near future
global warming created worldwide coastal flooding  displacing millions people
sun ( possibly dying ) belches massive solar flares  wreak havoc technology environment
perky news mannequins chirp tiananmen square style massacre environmental activists tsk-tsk family murder-suicide conducted via chainsaw
world gone mad !
phang uses sense looming environmental societal catastrophe metaphor emotional storms raging within souls protagonists ( much way person person dark suburban drama ice storm ) global chaos serves backdrop travails single-parented person family  living spielbergian location desert suburb led exasperated saura ( person person )
person classic mad housewife ; perpetually exasperated dead feet trying juggle full time job still spend quality time attending needs live-in boyfriend ( person person ) two children
saura  along introverted number-year old son timothy ( alexander agate ) confused teenaged daughter person ( sanoe lake ) dealing abandonment issues since dad took hike time back
young timothy  becomes central character piece fashion  escapes truly fucked-up adult behavior surrounds ( possibly averts years therapy process ) losing escapist reveries  triggered imaginative crayon doodles
brief visually arresting scenes nicely interpreted colorful blend cg effects waking life style rotoscoping
splash person 's spirited away sequences ( traumatized child finding solace personal empowerment unfettered fantasizing )
unfortunately  phang makes arguably fatal misstep taking concept literal plane
without giving much away  'll say film weirdly veers person person
phang wrestles nice performances mostly unknown cast  particularly nickson lake  give air immediacy authenticity mother-daughter dynamic
could another person person person young agate
person quite effective playing certain type creepy suburban wasp character become staple twisty indie family angst dramas ( eg
person person person stepfather  person person happiness  person person person everyone know )
assessing half-life one tough calls
didn ' hate - 'm still vacillating whether liked film
think safe say person person shows great promise  definitely director keep eye
one made-to-order-for-sundance entries diehard art-film enthusiasts delight ; undoubtedly others detest intensity thousand suns
blood brothers  woo  baby
film festival would complete without fistful entries location location action factory
one visually stylish genre pics 've seen far year 's siff first-time director person person
although story pure pulp could stood little script doctoring  's shot rich tones person film plays like number-minute dance mix location location 's greatest hits
produced hong kong cinema legend person person  blood brothers noodle western posing gangster saga  narrative tad reminiscent woo 's number classic  bullet head
's story setup may seen twice
two brothers  feng ( person person ) hu ( person person ) make pact lifelong buddy kang ( liu ye ) break backwater hick village head exotic sophisticated metropolis find fame  fortune  uh  exotic sophisticated babes
think hbo 's entourage  substituting race top criminal underworld numbers location success present day organization brass ring tale
handsome charismatic person babe magnet trio ( would movie star  vincent chase )
younger brother person frequently overshadowed chronically underachieving two siblings ( um-there 's johnny drama )
last least  physically intimidating  fiercely protective kang  thuggish cunningly street smart ( sort morph person location )
perhaps could refer person  fredo sonny corleone
nawthat 's easy !
carry entourage analogy  man location make break three friend 's fortunes happens ( wait ) organization movie producer
actuality  boss hong ( sun honglei ) adept producing piles bullet-riddled corpses producing films ; 's ruthless propensity made one location 's successful feared crime lords
among many enterprises paradise night club  person finds job brother feng spots object instant desire  lovely lulu ( person person )  boss hong 's squeeze requisite femme fatale piece
serendipity lands three pals boss hong 's employ  eventually trusted inner circle  friendship blood ties get sorely tested corruption power ( see godfather ii  scarface  upon time location  etc )
despite fact somewhat clich gangster tale  lot plot points ' bear well closer scrutiny  really enjoyed film done panache
' know location location directors  've got kind cinematic kavorka oozes cool
watch person person 's pre-hollywood era classics  's easy see person contemporaries geek much genre best ape work ( although american imitators  try might  never quite match effortless vibe overseas inspirations ; liken comparing kansas yes )
genre fans want watch domestic distribution perhaps dvd road
