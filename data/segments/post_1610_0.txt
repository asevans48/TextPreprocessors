think major point everyone missing people would get married benefits attached union
remove benefits  would anyone wish get married
another point issue  marriage religious icon
government issuing benefits based edicts established religion
people wish get married divorced  uncle sam number states really care
summarize  gay marriage hurt us
hurts us allowing government violate constitution respecting beliefs established religion
vote gay marriage vote form marriage two people must register union government
forefathers fought stamp tax  yet number years later constitution raped laws fought slowly yoked around necks
