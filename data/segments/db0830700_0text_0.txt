observation changelingby tristeroi hope dennis won ' mind straying yet onto beat
saw changeling  new person person film starring person person think 's one best films - level unforgiven  sure  still excellent movie
'd curious get take ( dennis  reviewed
couldn ' find anything )
curious story behind movie tried google
ways differs actual true story confirmed thoughts person person works
rest post severe spoiler alert
please see movie first
story probably came attention person and/or collaborators article la times february number  number
person co
filled details regarding wineville chicken coop murders
's one link piece story 's wikipedia
simplify  person went far order sanitize story
partly  's really happened ghastly comes close person person territory  person 's audience today  wouldn ' work commercially
gone  course  unnecessary complications  like person ' jailbird husband ( complete perfectly serviceable red herring son kidnapped ex-con seeking revenge husband )
person also dramatically cleaned sordid tale northcott mudererers  eliminating  example  person person 's mother   unlike son  actually convicted murder person person

tamping interest seeing/hearing unique ways perpetrate atrocities enables place main focus film person 's story  desperately calls cops becomes victimized passed law enforcement location location end number 's
's things get interesting  real sense  changeling becomes film corrupt  violent  law-ignoring government  contemptuous rules  manufacturing fake feelgood stories deflect criticism investigation abuses
also story compliant  lazy press far eager print stories  easily fit standard sentimental journalistic narratives `` tough love `` law-and-order government behave
dare question government and/or press accounts behavior  risk publicly declared insane disappeared
finally  incessant  nearly obsessional rants disseminated new  relatively inexpensive  powerful alternative mass media torture  corruption  incompetence rogue government exposed denounced
sound familiar
person far sophisticated filmmaker anyone claim bush administration changeling
serial killer angle huge maguffin ( btw  person quotes least hitchcock film  foreign correspondent  check umbrellas steps )
film fits easily genre la noir - chinatown  la confidential  name two examples - certainly main focus film  principle narrative plot
however  'm suggesting person much subtle artist late period make film `` `` la lowlife anymore person making movies samurai ( yes  course  person 's greater filmmaker )
barely hidden subtext changeling present time hero strong  even shrill  voice fights powers everything 's got
