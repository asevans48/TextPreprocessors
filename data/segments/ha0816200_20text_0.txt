location announced intention help muslim country run extremists build nuclear-power system  us demanded end  proclaiming danger world peace
us thing  much threat
rep
person person wants know bush administration splits particular hair start helping location location split atoms  person wonders haven ' pushed location location towards solar power instead  weakens argument enormously
' use solar power deserts significant degree  good reason 's viable long-term massive electrical production
storage technology advanced enough make solar power work  else 'd using instead coal
however  good point expense security subsidizing location location 's nuclear-power venture
even saudis best intentions  big problem radicals extremists  patrons royal family
nation extreme official application wahhabism let fifteen girls die fire rather allow flee school wearing appropriately islamic clothing time
women still can not drive  let alone vote
kind country want hand keys nuclear power
bush administration may another argument program  perhaps even two  considering current state region
administration may believe nothing stop location producing nuclear weapons  wants set saudis regional counterweight
's best argument  's dangerous one
likelihood overthrown misc royal family exactly remote  nuclear technology falls hands successor regime comprised even radical wahhabists  made region twice unstable
location location could eventually achieve nuclear technology  course  may bush administration argument
us controls kind nuclear power saudis get  keep transformed weapons technology
makes sense  especially since saudis already declared intention seek peaceful nuclear power
could push towards kinds reactors ' lend producing weapons-grade fissile material remain control program  keep closer eye inside outside
seems  though  best way keep countries gaining nuclear weapons cut revenue streams
started drilling oil us adopted nuclear power want give saudis  could undercut current pricing structure makes nations flush cash
instead relying middle eastern resources  could rely  producing jobs energy market crashes organization
way  ' give nuclear power wahhabist extremists use counterweight misc extremists
