yesterday  wrote first half remake andromeda strain provided fun ride one didn ' mind story getting dumbed lifetime channel set characters addition several hysterically paranoid subplots
least beat pacing original  even lacked tautness science first movie 's realism
described loss number iq points
well  case  finale dropped iq level barely sentient implosion seen since hollow man
note  spoiler alert
may want stop reading 've recorded show later viewing might thank explaining burn tivo case tas ' stupidity might infect recordings
end first episode  political correctness pretty much run amuck  thought
finale  got even thought could crammed four-hour show
crisis vent mining ocean floor turns terrorist crisis  's end subplot
two doctors fall love 're supposed saving world
one military doctor turns gay  since 's key man  gives opportunity say  's ironic
one person military fears turns one trust save day
even us think ' t-ask-don ' t-tell hypocritical rolled eyes development  nothing anything else movie
's beginning stupidity
turns andromeda messenger nearby wormhole
message
' mess vent mining
entire infection comes future  vent mining apparently turned worse hysterics fantasize pumping oil anwr
humanity send andromeda packing material back past message  based binary code hidden deep within molecular structure  tell us leave mother earth alone
course  one bothers ask future earth way would kill every living organism past earth
one script conference created bothered ask future earth wouldn ' send metal plate wormhole said  hey !
stop vent mining !
love  grandchildren
wouldn ' effective lot less likely  say  kill future earth 's ancestors
maybe could send message back said  hey !
'll stop vent mining quit playing killer organisms !
love  grandma grandpa
send influenza payback
ending provides biggest unintentional laughs
military doctor designated key man  one stop self-destruct sequence laboratory provide unimaginable power andromeda mutations
unlike novel  dies falls tunnel pool water used nuclear reactor  hands key stop sequence project leader
unfortunately  key sequence requires military doctor 's thumb identification  leads another doctor mr
spock ( wrath person ) go water cut thumb
throws thumb straight two stories project leader 's hanging side wall  complete close-up  slo-mo sequence thumb tumbling towards hero self-sacrificing doctor dies pool water wouldn ' radioactive anyway
provides perfect analogy entire movie
way mess get thumbs-up reviewer cut one protest threw air
rest ending fairly anticlimactic  assorted assassinations everyone starts covering government 's role affair
everyone 's loved ones suddenly finds free personal problems plagued
president declares 'll continue vent mining despite strongly-worded memo future  makes sense ; 'd try kill future earth  stunt like andromeda
shame
could interesting ; instead  gives peek mind politically-correct paranoids produced dreck
