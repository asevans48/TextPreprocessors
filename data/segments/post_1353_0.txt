particularly true one instance can not inferred universally true instances
arguments reason true one example conclusion universal fallacious
example  andsoccer hair  person male ; therefore  males hair
moreover  true today judgment may necessarily true fact
though judgment may valid today judgment precludes right change mind something unaware would alter judgment
judged person gay today doesn ' rule possibility judgment may change future
one last statement   's obvious homosexuals raised heterosexuals
reason  nobody validly argue parents sexual orientation predetermines sexual orientation children
