well
yet  anyway
funny misc cops keep misunderstanding hate crimes laws
legal training reading story april  'd say cop pretty firm handle law headed
spend time last link see far road already
location  far know  hate crimes constitutionally charged connection another criminal offense
' charged hate ; charged assault sentence enhanced prove assault motivated hate
thoughtcrime + actual crime = hate crime  words
uk  sounds like 're flirting knocking pesky actual crime element going whole nine orwellian yards
exit quotation  per cop  warned
come back get beaten  well warned
're silenced safety  see  logic sounds distressingly familiar  well
( bonus nuance  longtime ha readers know  cop 's worries sort thing especially unwelcome location necessarily unfounded  )
