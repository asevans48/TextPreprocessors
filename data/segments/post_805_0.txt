cops always going disadvantage never know carrying isn '  criminals always advantage surprise
present situation criminals carrying firearms would people actually follow law endanger hinder officers efforts
say wont able tell attacker shooting event find one instance happened college campus looked couldn ' find even one instance
also since says concealed means concealed carry full size handgun many friends ' know carry one ever noticed
also reason ' believe need rifles campus can not concealed gets rid element surprise
really need go google `` semiautomatic ``  firearms sold today semiautomatic dangerous firearm
still fire one bullet one trigger pull like revolver hunting rifle  dangerous deadly
tell going protect armed attacker numberft  hell make numberft  fallacy liar
options yea possibly ; might able run away  maybe attacker stupid get close attempt move saw movie  maybe pepper spray person reacts way gets agitated angry kills anyways ( mention sprays take number seconds fully start working also banned college campuses )
carry gun everyday times legal ' look everyone potential enemy understand accept fact evil people would hurt family whatever takes keep loved ones safe
also reasoning every cop location carries firearm way using weapon wrong reason hasty impulse
remember cops people also make mistakes statistically make mistakes armed civilians  cwp holders law abiding group citizens country look statistics location texas ( two states keep best records ) find around
number
number % cwp holders ever arrested felony
research come random scenarios could possibly happen occur college campuses everywhere else concealed carry legal making statistics fit opinion
