analogy doesn ' work could dirty run water fountains reserved strictly one group nice clean ones another group  ``
claim segregation unconstitutional facilities lesser quality blacks
implication facilities absolutely equal respects  would legal
therefore say since marriage civil unions afford rights ( ' even come close told  irrelevant point ) also legal
unfortunately us history seems bit rusty
doctrine separate equal  established supreme court case plessy person person
supreme court ruled segregation constitutional
number supreme court made new decision segregation case brown v board education
constitutional basis case equal protection clause fourteenth amendment
supreme court decided quality black white schools change fact separate inherently equal
quotes decision  `` segregation white negro children public schools state solely basis race  pursuant state laws permitting requiring segregation  denies negro children equal protection laws guaranteed fourteenth amendment - - even though physical facilities `` tangible `` factors white negro schools may equal  ``
``  unlike sweatt v painter  findings negro white schools involved equalized  equalized  respect buildings  curricula  qualifications salaries teachers  `` tangible `` factors  ``
`` separate others similar age qualifications solely race generates feeling inferiority status community may affect hearts minds way unlikely ever undone  ``
see segregation would unconstitutional regardless relative qualities things segregated
therefore analogy works perfectly
even civil unions marriages granted exact rights  '  making gays get different form marriage `` generates feeling inferiority status community may affect hearts minds way unlikely ever undone  ``
consequently unconstitutional equal protection clause fourteenth amendment homosexual unions given different moniker
druthers would prefer states issue civil unions couples marriage licenses marriage religious connotations
barring gays must allowed get married well  ``
( know difficult grasp ) since separation church state  supreme court doesn ' say word churches use  ``
never made assertion assertion logical conclusion
enjoy red herring
tastes fishy
