survey saysby digbyi find interesting curious think mean coming campaign  person person elected president  number % voters say 's least somewhat likely reach across party lines work effectively republicans democrats
fifty-two percent ( number % ) say true person person elected president
two candidates remain competitive person reports daily presidential tracking poll
eighty-five percent ( number % ) republicans believe person would reach across party lines effectively

person seen uniting candidate men women  young old  white voters  conservatives moderates
person seen way african-americans  minority voters  politically liberal
assuming person nominee  argue putting republican like person person ticket
argue person reach beyond base coalition something tack right meet person person `` middle  `` spun
conflicted
conventional wisdom says dems try turn person 's image doctrinaire conservative person sort dramatic bipartisan gestures like picking republican ticket
first part won ' easy `` maverick `` reputation well established think still needs hit hard
republicans bums want throw right  person republican  maverick
going brand worth party ticket races alone
second half equation  'm quite sure
's certainly going tempting person  assuming nominee  move pretty hard right counteract `` liberal member congress `` rap
many people argue must restore bipartisan cred year 's established conventional wisdom thing people yearn anything unity consensus
'm entirely sure 's people actually want
sense always people terribly dissatisfied government direction country 've never convinced attribute problems location much partisan loyalty democratic party
may wrong  would love see data support idea go democratic/republican ticket ( would nearly impossible feel enthusiastic  although 'd fall line  )
think would great person rejected predictable paradigm ran purely reformer/populist platform instead bipartisan consensus platform
think 's ample reason believe would successful trying maverick maverick  would give democrats mandate real change instead mandate compromise
perhaps misread public mood want anything everyone get along
think part person 's popularity independents perceive method `` reaching across party lines `` think 'll knock heads together force people bend
' know person running right  democrats wont general elections  counteract particular style leadership
something different called
'm entirely sure perceptions point
need smoke clear bit accurately see lay land
maybe country really yearning bipartisan compromise reject tough guy approach outright
's case  tacking right issues putting republican ticket may actually smart move
'm convinced 's necessary certainly ' think 's desirable
comments still fubared
