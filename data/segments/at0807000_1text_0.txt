first  say 's well done ; 's well-written could agree thesis
person  must take exception use galileo myth  galileo affair misunderstood  mischaracterizedand used impugn church christianity general
'm sure realize  heliocentric belief originate galileo ancient greeks
lent credibility polish astronomer person person treatise  `` revolutions heavenly orbs  ``
's instructive note  writer person person person wrote `` galileo affair  `` `` copernicus  good catholic  published book urging two eminent prelates dedicated pope person person  received cordially  ``
moreover  church protected copernicus calvinistsand others would persecuted
's also important understand church view theories threat modern critics would suppose would taken
point fact  churchmen largely uninterested things
cardinal baroniusonce said  bible `` intended teach us go heaven  heavens go  ``
galileo encounter problems
seems certainly enough blame go around  obvious punished propounding theory around thousands years entertained church ( church regarded person hypothesis ) ;
one thing  person irascibleman insisted church accept theory wholesale  without adequate proof ; could even refute aristotle 's objection pertaining stellar parallaxes
moreover  church correct circumspection  galileo ' stheories later disproven ; instance  wrong saying tides caused rotation earth nature comets
parallel seen today respect evolution  pope person person person called `` one number possibilities  ``
man endure hundred years theory toto proven correct  wouldn ' surprising critics church found ways cast adamantly opposed
possible entity doesn ' jump bandwagons heading right direction ; however  often overlooked doesn ' jump going wrong one
point
church thinks terms years  centuries
person doesn ' jump bandwagon ; rather  considers positions sober fashion  searches truth waits till facts
wouldn ' great global warming crowd disposed
moreover  church especially reluctant jump scientific bandwagons isn ' scientific body
although seems strange say today  number years ago heliocentrismwas bandwagon
thankful church exercises wisdom
note current organization jumped global warming bandwagon ; instead  recently made pronouncement wherein emphasized one things current global-warming alarmismwas reflection sincere search truth  rather  motivated desire advance agenda
thus  measure  person actually like global warming alarmiststhan church
person man insisted trying ram unproven theory people 's throats  theory containing elements  fact  incorrect
isn ' say direct equivalence galileo ' stheories today 's anthropogenic global warming thesis ( agwt )
former basically sound flawed elements  believe latter basically flawed  best  sound elements
regardless  agwtis bandwagon today  heliocentrismat time organization
accepting unproven scientific theories fact isn ' practice good scientists good theologians
certain rash brash individuals embrace practice right instances doesn ' change fact
love lewis ' piece  would encourage others read
mustn ' fall trap global warming dogmatists
accepting something fact simply 's fashionable say
