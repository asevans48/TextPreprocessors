please please please go research post things incorrect full fallacies misconceptions
going attempt answer assumptions one time
first number obtain concealed weapons permit ( cwp ) number year-olds isn ' going happen
next number small paragraphs  sorry feel like would owned carried gun history shows us none scenarios listed happened ever
cwp holders carry everywhere campus imaginary line crossing campus suddenly make everyone irresponsible basically stupid
stuff doesn ' happen campus would mysteriously happen campus
drinking many times gone drunk class
know never anyone know
obviously ' know number cwp holders us assume enough multiple cwp holders one place one shooting take ( never happened anywhere campus happen campus )
us number cwp holder every number citizens
number-number age group much lower range number number
largest lecture class number + students statistically might number cwp holder carrying weapon self defense
next section state instances several times guns going
working firearms long time also instructor tell certainty presently built firearm goes
companies go way make sure firearm cant go  almost new firearms also drop safeties could throw car numbermph still wouldn ' go ( would ruin perfectly good handgun tho )
seeing writing genuine fear firearms sorry  really suggest go local range go talk people possibly taking class better understand firearms use really ' understand
becoming desensitized gunshots  first scenarios completely baseless wouldn ' massive increase gunfire anyways  even ( never would happen ) people ' know sound firearm really makes anyways
assume car backfiring firecracker
allowing teachers carry students difference first year teacher number year old location veteran going back school
teacher better qualified student
