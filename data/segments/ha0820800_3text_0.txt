wrote days ago ducked person person 's question torturing distinction tactics strategy
according one  president sets strategy  troops number months left behind various missions
generals supply tactics  carry missions responsibly  need x number troops
x equal
's entirely conditions-based  team person points person person 's column week citing unnamed person advisors saying could mean leaving many number troops place
according recent essay person person  runs obama 's working group location  near term might keep many number brigades overwatch  ie
support  duties
person 's top priority really withdrawal  location policy begin setting number troops 's comfortable leaving field asking recommendations missions feasible given number
fact 's going way  starting missions building drawdown around  decidedly mccain-esque ( ie
conditions-based  ie
responsible ) approach
tweaked person morning lately come around many positions  light  maverick almost mirror images location  person thinks troop levels depend conditions concedes number months pretty good timetable whereas person thinks number months pretty good timetable concedes  er  troop levels depend conditions
nuance
predictably  person camp crowing
's statement  hot presses  key remaining conceptual difference  course  type missions mind residual troops
mccain surely imagines something ambitious  person something limited support-oriented
watch debate shift subject next  especially light big ap story afternoon talking troops field already shifting peacekeeper roles ( 've awhile parts location ) reconstruction support
us peacekeepers question president person
'll see
update  per last paragraph evolving scope mission  reader notes person 's residual force would theoretically contain combat troops
big difference person  sure  read ap story
's much combat going location anymore would require combat troops anyway
issue peacekeepers  troops going walk beat  see sporadic action  reassure iraqis 's strong security presence available deal contingencies ia gets speed
