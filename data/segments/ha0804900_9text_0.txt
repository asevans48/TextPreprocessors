usa today 's person person captain ed think  posit mormon issue underlying driver
think 're oversimplifying
mormon issue played role  ' think important role evangelicals never really warmed mitt
also think overstate influence evangelical leaders like dr
person person
leaders influential  influential outsiders think
'll use example
'm evangelical came around supporting person best alternative person late game  location primary
person issue nothing  though
flipflop issue fred issue everything
evangelicals  huckaboom also played decisive role
anyone disagrees isn ' trusted analyst
keed
first  flipflop issue
huge
candidates presidency go  paper romney stood broad experience olympics  businessman governor
easily qualified job
person person number number didn ' sound much like person person number-number
person explained changes heart  added knowing really believes
doesn ' know believes  voter supposed know believes
' figure really believes  'll hard time voting
eventually came around supporting romney became convinced mitt numbernumber 'll stay
evangelicals probably never got far  though
huckabee misc leader race  social issues huck  went
never heard record immigration weaknesses national security
'll get huckaboom minute  happened fred factor
fred 's emergence possibility race early number gave conservatives place put hopes
fred said wrote right things
fred took attention time away three things  person collapse  person 's attempts convince conservatives one us  examination person 's conservative bona fides
us didn ' yet trust person  didn ' want person  worried person discounted huckabee looked fred one real conservative race could unite conservative movement
fred fizzled
campaign never really got ground
ended wasting time sucking space person could used cast fred deeper resume
came huckaboom
evangelicals didn ' yet trust person  didn ' like person ( also ended wasting time security conservatives )  didn ' want person  along comes witty southern preacher/governor
person became vessel evangelical enthusiasm
didn ' record flipflopping core social issues
didn ' record like person 's opposing gop platform serial marriage
didn ' person 's record maverick irascibility calling social con leaders agents intolerance
long huckabee 's record didn ' get scrutinized closely national security  border security economics  viable candidate
problem huck appeal never broke beyond evangelicals never likely
time huckaboom  fred done person rise  rebuilt retooled campaign fallen apart
person 's rise coincided time conservatives started take third fourth look alternatives began settle person person
trajectory
mormon issue played role thinking
dobson et al played role
'm sure played role thinking evangelicals  wasn ' decisive either gilgoff capt ed think
fundamentally  candidates brought serious problems table
religious right certainly isn ' blame
one thing left hanging think worth noting  's person isn ' worst candidate could stuck point
's probably third worst terms dividing party  's worst
person huckabee would worse  reasons unique
person much record going party person  plus immense personal baggage
huckabee would divided social cons sharply economic cons showed lightweight national security
matter bad think things right  'm least taking solace fact could 've worse
person still needs fire juan person  though
