person person gives thoughtful rebuttal arguments misc left right misc war location  trying push beyond slogans find better ground
easily dispenses asinine proportionality argument rejects right vs wrong equation  preferring ask whether location acted wisely actions  construct suffers one problem lack recognition misc actions past
location tried military action  occupation  withdrawal  peace plan ( location )  another peace plan ( wye river )  yet another peace plan ( location )  blockade  ending blockade  series so-called truces allowed palestinians play triangle offense provoke location action
actions common
none worked
question really isn ' right wrong
location right defend citizens attack  organization launched number rocket mortar attacks civilian populations week operation
's smart stupid  either  since location done everything advance cause peace justice except surrender die  remains hamas ' explicitly stated aim
's lack options dealing group determined conduct terrorist attacks destroy location last breath
targeted campaign hamas avoiding wider war one option israelis still yet try
better question whether work  person 's implied test smart-or-stupid construct
' know
know location options left outside suicide  ' see whether work 's tried
