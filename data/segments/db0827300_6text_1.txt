' actually get person intent upon letting organization fail environment
maybe experiment
whatever  seems made things worse  although doesn ' necessarily translate kind massive bailout subsequently proposed either
perhaps king person clueless
's person 's reasoning 's better hold one 's nose vote plan let pass  'm asked two big questions thing  ( number ) really necessary
( number ) shouldn ' dems tossed whole paulson approach window done something completely different
( number )  answer yes
's true parts real economy ok even face financial disruption ; big companies still sell bonds ( lots cash hand )  qualifying home buyers still get fannie-freddie mortgages
commercial paper  important lot businesses  trouble  'm hearing anecdotes reduced credit lines causing smaller businesses pull back
plus 's serious chance run hedge funds  could make things lot worse
economy already looking like 's headed serious recession definition  risks nothing look high
's true might able stagger case-by-case rescues think person  three  many aigs strategy ; fact  might point person hadn ' decided make example organization
right 's even clear rescue  credit markets freezing read ( number-month t-bill numbernumber %  ted spread numbernumber ) ( number )  call tougher
putting barney frank person person 's shoes  'd look way  democrats could start  bailout plan  say  centered purchases preferred stock takeovers failing firms basically  plan clearly focused recapitalizing financial sector  nationalization necessary
's plan looked like
maybe plan would passed congress ; maybe  maybe bush would signed ; person certainly desperate deal
plan would next republican votes republicans would demagogued full tilt
democratic leadership can not  can not  seen sole ownership stuff
think  done way
' like  ' like plan  see constraints dodd  person  person  reid operating
see politics way
problem democrats pretty much governing entity working today
bush boys lame ducks political stake outcome
republicans stand gain obstructionists environment either coming election almost certainly next one
opportunity
democrats different set problems held responsible economic failure majority
say think 've handled correctly
think 've far willing accept responsibility - - - see hunger leadership power written faces
're wonky types like stuff
felt choice ( debatable point  sure ) holding noses refusing anything public without paulson  bush republican leadership standing arm arm every single time
kind illusion politically helpful  nuts
republicans  bush disappeared bill person  person person person person cooked crisis together white house coffee person person back number
( ' think won ' work  )
lot bloggers asking readers call representatives vote bill
think 's good idea  honest tell ' think make difference
polls showing people general pretty supportive person democrats far  higher scores person democrats congress relative person republicans congress mainly owing differences intraparty support side
nearly number number democrats approve way person responded wall street crisis  compared number number republicans approving person
similarly  number % democrats approve democratic leaders congress  location number % republicans approving republican leaders congress
bill going fail republicans decided follow person person 's advice reanimate gop corpse backs faux fiscal responsibility
however  important democrats understand constituents dismayed bail republicans '
otherwise  likely think taking ownership crisis political interest definitely isn '
frankly  'm scared crisis
democrats ' fully grasp political stakes next generation even bigger fools thought
one defining moments persist showing press conferences high fiving congratulating publicly bailing rich people  signing death warrants
economic crisis isn ' going away
'd better figure right politics right popular support isn ' going last
