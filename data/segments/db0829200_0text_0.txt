saturday night moviesw  stone looks back rightby person person location 's finest actorsno one ever accused oliver stone subtle
however  audiences view highly anticipated film concerning life times george person person  think popular perception director  rabid conspiracy theorist rewrites history via grand guignol-fueled cinematic polemics  could begin diminish
'm even going go limb ( gulp ! )
call w fairly straightforward biopic
stone intersperses highlights ( right word  )
bush 's white house years episodic flashbacks flash forwards  ostensibly beginning late numbers ( junior attending organization ) taking us present day
' think full plot summary necessary ; regular hullabaloo reader  know story well  alcoholic son texas oil millionaire stumbles early adulthood  gets organization ( eventually organization ) back door  marries librarian  discovers special purpose helping poppy become president
thanks savvy guidance homunculus sidekick dubs person  elected governor texas ( twice ) finds god  informs personally destined become president  special mission
turns special mission fight evil doers live  stage terrorist attack location
trouble  seems confusion exactly live
meantime  'll need bitch slap bill rights ( little )  protection
best supporting performance
'm saying stone doesn ' take point view ; wouldn ' oliver stone didn '
's already catching flak corners amount screen time spent dwelling bush 's battle bottle ( say manufacturers person person must laid serious bucks ubiquitous product placement throughout film )
bush 's history boozing matter record
's part story ( could explain lot things )
taking umbrage one underlying themes person person 's screenplay  bush 's angst ( drive succeed costs ) propelled unrequited desire please perennially disapproving george senior
'm psychologist  sounds reasonable
live  new yorkit 's saturday night !
usual  stone assembled massive cast bazillion speaking parts ( daresay matches late person person department )
choice person person lead initially struck many people odd selection ( including truly )  seen film  say smart move
person nothing short brilliant
doesn ' go cartoon caricature  would easy route take ; think pulls person person lewis-worthy total immersion quite successfully
interesting note person ( tangential junior ) accused riding organization career coattails dad ( person person ) stepmother ( person person ) ; stone chose leading man mind  canny operator
standouts cast include person person ( infamous ) karl rove  person person great person person president mrs
bush sr
person person person person person person ( perfect ! )
person person
wright person play beautifully recreating person powell 's tiffs
person person isn ' given awful lot person person  evil squint
misfire overly mannered person person condoleezza rice ; like dropped unexpectedly saturday night live sketch
perhaps entirely fault  put much prosthetic face  barely move lips
perhaps qualify something
called straightforward biopic top review  speaking relative terms
keep mind one respect  stone boldly going filmmaker gone
pt number aside  biopic president released still sitting oval office ; since former film dealt jfk 's wwnumber exploits  actual presidency  believe makes stone 's film even unique
another hurdle consider fact bush administration probably satirized  parodied ridiculed ( via print  blogosphere  tv  film  theater  comedy club  youtube  t-shirt  billboard  semaphore  smoke signal conversations around water cooler ) presidency lifetime ( haven ' asked every way imaginable )
god  see president 's mug cnn ; within moments bound say something biting lower lip passing coffee nose ( hey  even grim laughter qualifies levity  dark times )
zeitgeist makes virtually impossible someone make serious biopic george person person
playing straight  stone really subversive ( clever boy ! )
