energy independence become buzzword number presidential election
want move away middle east oil  least  order keep held economic hostages hostile governments region
avoid increasing importation location  whose tar sands location deep reserves friends would like sell us
problem solved  right
wrong  bill classified oil tar sands alternative fuel  places restrictions use
unlike regular crude  us government can not buy alternative fuels unless release less greenhouse gas
tar-sands crude unfortunately doesn ' qualify  's even close ; produces much emissions regular crude
canadians  needless say  nonplussed action congressional democrats
want sell us crude  armed services could certainly use reliable source energy dependent mullahcracies kleptocracies
location  even though already reliable friendly trade location oil commercial purposes tar sands  us military take pass stick nigerians  venezuelans  saudis
make sense
