idiotic saga didn '  launched person 's announcement 'd disband jam shiite clerics told  reaches absurd conclusion
person won ' talk press  're left divine intentions intermediaries
surprise  sadr 's people say gave thumbs person 's chief rivals shiite supremacy say gave thumbs
sort
thumbs version  thumbs  via bill roggio  believe
're absolutely contradictory ; 's possible clerics want disarm leave disbanding  although read seems bit overly nuanced given politics stake
case believe
's worth noting ' find thumbs version voi website  although upi 's credible enough agency 'll take word 's
even still two problems
first  source person person  whose story seems change hour  initially said location 's shiite clerics refused order sadr disband  said person never asked first place  's claiming person ask  person know  're side
second  note meeting  person  haeri allegedly took place location
understanding person rarely leaves location  almost certainly wouldn ' person call low-level punk like sadr  whatever political power may wield
might location business since   shiite holy city  ' find reports wires traveling
fact  two days ago reuters reported person forming delegation visit person location
maybe met convinced come back location talk
maybe 's big pile muq-brand person
either way  sounds like 's keeping army
