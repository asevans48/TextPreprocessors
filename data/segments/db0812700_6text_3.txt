indeed  reading book  often strange feeling deja vu - - - events  arguments made around

many families like mine  privileged franklin kids raised affluent post war world world war ii era orthogonian parents

perlstein believes nixonland unique moment american history agree  ( although tend think earthquake dramatically opened long standing fissures american society rather unique event someday  )
either way  agree isn ' yet
think  number year period numbers blink eye broad historical sense yet fundamental changes taken place society time
's surprising would turmoil resistance
surprising badly grasp way american tribes work even though 've circling around long time
nixonland wonderful  entertaining history filled fascinating characters evoked loving penetrating detail
nixon features heavily  course ( fascinating  )
probably important politician last half numberth century character  many ways  encompasses contradictions america represents
