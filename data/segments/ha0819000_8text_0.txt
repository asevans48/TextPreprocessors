democrats won majorities chambers congress  pointed falling approval ratings legislature mandate change
certainly provided albeit wrong direction
person 's latest polling shows approval ratings congress reached new low  new achievement single digits  democrats first took control congress  approval rating sat number %  explained quite bit electoral victory democrats achieved
managed push number % four monthsin charge  gone downhill ever since may number
people used joke hitting single digits  day finally arrived leadership person person person person
oddly  time democrats maintained lead person 's generic congressional ballot
last week 's poll shows number-point gap  slightly narrower number-point gap mid-june  wider six-point gap april
gop obviously done good job explaining lack progress issues tying misc leadership  seems like opportunity missed least far
energy everyone 's mind  republicans chance change
democrats decided wait wind rather anything ease supply crisis driven prices pump sight
republicans take charge implement rational energy policy includes robust domestic production position gained popularity voters increase standing expose person person true obstructionists
outside partisan considerations  people 's branch government disrepute seems somewhat dangerous
congress needs take action restore confidence representative branch federal government  include end corruption mechanisms pork
can not afford wait number sink zero repairing credibility
