democrats congress promised make energy policy high priority returned independence day break
instead  quietly scrubbed schedule votes energy bill  afraid republicans make vote increased domestic oil production force choose popular sentiment drilling environmentalist allies
strategy
well  hill chooses good quote  break  democrats heralded two bills supposedly showed leadership energy  anti-speculator measure use lose bill forced oil companies drill federal leases whether found oil yet lose leases immediately
attacked republicans opposed bills oil-company lackeys  truth neither bill produces single drop oil solve supply crisis
bills disappeared legislative calendar  republicans ideas
organization reports person person plan peel moderate democrats senate get approval drilling combining effort conservation mandates
person already five democrats ready vote drilling  find  effectively sideline slip-up searchlight keep getting ill  moderate democrats begun asking gang number energy
person person ( d-ne ) taken lead demand  nine senators parties willing join
amounts rebellion person person knee-jerk opposition increased domestic production oil coal
sick speech may last straw democrats see american public demanding domestic production recognize political danger approaches november obstructionists
course  democrats always option going november slogan  drive smaller cars wait wind
'm sure 'll see television ads bumper stickers highlighting strategy
unfortunately democrats  produced republicans demonstrate utter bankruptcy democratic energy policy
