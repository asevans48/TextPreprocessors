person person pickens  legendary texas oilman  bit media blitz past days  promoting wind-power  things
isn ' new cause pickens - - 's proponent `` peak oil theory ``  developing enormous wind farm texas years  seeing several major international energy companies come state start
past days  pickens launched tv ads  website ( pickensplan )  op-ed yesterday 's wall street journal ( plan escape grip foreign oil )
plan eliminate dependence foreign oil focuses three sources energy  although obvious reasons goes great detail two - wind natural gas
plan calls taking energy generated wind using replace significant percentage natural gas used fuel power plants
today  natural gas accounts number % electricity generation us use new wind capacity free natural gas use transportation fuel
would displace one-third foreign oil imports
natural gas domestic energy size used replace oil used transportation  abundant usthat 's commendable long-term goal
pickens feels accomplished within number-number years  putting $ number billion money behind wind farm show sincerity
turn reality  several major infrastructure problems must solved
end  latest media blitz
federal government going several things right bat ; otherwise looks location state really going benefit wind energy
government must mandate formation wind solar transmission corridors  renew subsidies economic alternative energy development areas wind sun abundant
addition  substantial upgrades nation 's power grid delivery systems undertaken  whole country take advantage new source power
enormous local political problems associated
two examples  take look person person 's crusade wind power cape cod  read person person ' silly underhanded maneuvers derail attempts deliver lng ( natural gas ) southeastern new england ( mr
frank 's wild river )
note opposition cleaner energy strategy coming `` liberal lions `` usual suspects left - - people groups one would assume would backing types projects
's important note  however  pickens plan represents part solution long-term energy needs
represent solution shorter-term oil gasoline price supply problem
pickens recognizes  includes throwaway line op-ed morning  drilling outer continental shelf considered well  need look options  recognizing silver bullet
nice think natural gas powered vehicles cruising along highways  would new  expensive vehicles
realistically  big deal already made past years cars use natural gas fuel source  yet hasn ' much corresponding demand vehicles consumers
number gasoline-powered vehicles location location today  vehicles  owners  need affordable gasoline
addition  note pickens ' main objective developing wind power generate electricity would power industry homes
currently mass produced wind-powered automobiles  ever
left run pickens plan use argue domestic oil drilling
right appreciate person ' capitalistic instinct  also recognize part solution  solution
left probably end opposing much road ( see person frank examples  )
plan doesn ' answer public 's cry cheaper gasoline
's getting around  want cheaper gasoline oil near future must increase domestic oil production
somehow  ' think pickens would problem
person lifson adds  skeptical upper end predictions potential wind power
wind constant source power  can not provide base load power
still need coal  person  conventional sources cake
wind frosting
lot maintenance involved power source switches direction intensity
wind farms also kick fair amount dust places soil dry
natural gas potential vehicles  though
however  obstacles distribution
liquefied natural gas handled safely  lot people risk averse explosive potential case accidents
respect admire person person pickens  isee problem complicated
