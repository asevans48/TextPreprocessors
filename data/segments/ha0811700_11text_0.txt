person person voiced many pundits suspect resolution democratic primary  ticket combines person person hillary clinton
called person ticket  allowing reconciliation two factions party increasingly become embittered race
rather combining strengths  though  combination could easily compound negatives give person person even easier targets hit general election  bigger question either would agree vp slot
obama would get eaten alive party constituencies surrendered hillary leading pledged delegates sell-out
hillary particular reason move senate do-nothing role obama administration wait 's close person 's age run presidency
would make much sense either take running mate
obama would allowing clintons run administration behind back  surely would  hillary would saddled someone much popular subordinate
could overcome motivations combine forces location  though
would help
perhaps would location  hardly helps either general election
despite hyperbole primary experience  truth neither track records executives  either impressive legislative careers
person beats combined latter  especially comes forging bipartisan coalitions sponsoring high-profile legislation
also military career vouch executive abilities  neither hillary person offer anything match
democrats need running mates least provide balance areas  like governor even someone long experience capitol hill
worst part dream ticket comes combination worst traits
instead offering someone lies assume experience doesn ' hard-left cipher hangs unrepentant domestic terrorists  democrats would offer time
combined negatives would present republicans almost unlimited grounds paint democrats touch  condescending  untruthful nanny-staters ' relate middle america
instead giving centrists independents reason vote democratic  'll double reasons support person person
so-called dream ticket anything
looks like convenient way democrats awaken nightmare primary race
