respond article mr meyer regarding support biofuels
mr meyer neglects mention things biofuels
make perfectly clear say fan biofuels  especially ethanol  consider alcohols  except maybe nitromethanol ( really useful drag racing ) perfectly horrid motor fuels
reasons follow  number
less energy gallon ethanol gallon gasoline
ethanol number btu 's per gallon gasoline number btu 's per gallon
means get much less fuel mileage using alcohol
number
transportation
gasoline transported using pipelines  ethanol can not must trucked using special tankers
much inefficient using network pipelines
number
alcohol based fuels net energy negative
takes energy distill alcohol energy provides
producing  save nothing fact cost world market energy
number
lastly  despite mr meyer 's protestations aside  diverting would normally grown feed corn human food effect overall prices
world wide demand rising less product  price rises
correct saying factor  still factor
number
alcohol based fuels hygroscopic
absorb water therefore short shelf life vs gasoline  much problem daily driver  won ' happy storing lawnmower classic car tank full alcohol
fact  race engine designed burn alcohols stored `` pickled `` ( run short time gasoline coat parts ) order avoid corrosion water
number
volatility
ethanol volatile gasoline  means evaporate much lower temperature gasoline
means get sent atmosphere gasoline conditions
means ethanol pollute gasoline
number
another point alcohol based fuels noone considered
grown  fuel `` independence `` would subject whims mother nature
floods  drought  disease would play factor price supply newest fuel source
despite protestations organization organization  financial stake industry  using alcohol based fuels bad deal us
person person due respect person person person  fine thinker writer  anything needs subsidy  mandate protective tariffs bad idea
henotably ignores environmental damage rivers gulf location phosphate runoff
nice try  sale
bob frederick****it true food prices beng pressurred improving worldwide economic lot ( heard certainly reinforces free markets  leaving chattering class socialists control ) fact land used corn production less used grains meat
need second wave green revolution means get rid certain romantic precepts limit ability produce foods
one thing accept gmo seed hybrydiuzation within lab stead field
romantic notions using biofuels reduce eliminate need foreign produced oil
truly want independence go get oil  utilize coal resources fullest  build nuclear generating plants  encourage micro solar uses  capture methane garbage dumps heat sewage plants
without impacting using food grains
may even able create hydrocarbon fuels using agricultural waste
heard defense budget subsidy everythig earth  argument specious best
ethanol subsidy  however  real cost driver great
free market ought work many ethanol folks want short circuit innovation
number number went belly tried work ethanol plant
way seen movie  know ending
oil prices fell whole argument alternative fuel imploded
predict oil prices fall argument alternative fuels implode
far even mentiopned potential environmental impact
steps see energy independence  fact really public good  number
since believe oil zero sum game  think need continue explore drill recover within us
anwar great places potential us
need continue improve recovery techniques  improved still leave lot ground
need understand can not let relatively selfish blue hairs one state control us
state comes senses country need cease providing huuricaine aid
number
need build number nuclear power stations
actually relatively safe location places
need continue work small solar panels southwest solar used homes adjunct power plant generated power
home location  could put solar collector roof thousand dollar would power mosat hose thday would
think much morereasonable approach mega projects
number
successuful increasing non carbon based electricity must convert activites fuled organization carbons electricity
urban regionl train bus sytems come mind
another memory childhood
work  general motors took lead destroying infrastructure number 's order better sell gmc buses
way another example unholy alliance government business
number
need next five years increase auto fleet efficiency bu two mile per gallon
might alleviate problem
number
lastly  bringing democracy free markets world help alleviate worldwide problem
nation resources needs
many folks country think island unto world economic situation zero summ game
fweel way ignorance fueled ignorant lazy press demogogic non productive polticians
wondered day relative margins oil companies newspapers
nyt favor windfall profits tax oil companies
know papers margins decreasing also know internet margins wonderful
wonder number comparison say nyt margin would comapred organization
actually problem newspapers  profitable raise managers
biofuels answer unless romanitic
jeff rogers****in mr
meyer 's biofuel article makes thecase defense budget like subsidy oil
true mr
meyer 's able tell us defense budget would withoutmaintaining free flow oil
guess free navigable seas wouldbe greatly diminishedimportance formiddle eastern oil
terrorism
police responsibility nothing military
rock shill ethanol industry emerge
didyou guys bother publish someone nothing lobbyist
angling become trade magazine government waste
sincerely  person person `` correction person person `` # number yes  fewer btu 's ethanol number per gallon compared regular gasoline 's numberregular gasoline number btu 's
enumber blended gasoline ethanol contains numberbtu 's numbernumber % energy regular gasoline
point person makes reduced mileage bogus day long
driver affect [ sic ] mileage fuelbeing used
never mind tire pressure  vehicle maintenance  alignment  crap bed trunk  etc
