location  world 's populous country  ironic problem  enough people attending olympics
plethora empty seats event  hotel business location actually worse usual time rooms filled capacity
location begun busing spectators cheer squads events begging citizens attend  thus far little success  location idea causing problem
expected olympic area overcrowded  underattended
even cheer squads  rounded workplaces throughout city  get dwarfed empty seats
foreigners arrived anywhere near numbers predicted
may suggest two reasons
first  location made clear would allow much freedom olympic presentation
reneged promise unhindered internet access journalists  post notes  imposed travel restrictions tourists want attend
ordinary location  course  doesn ' exactly scream welcome !
importantly  though  chinese oppression people made olympic venue poor choice
despite organization 's assertion olympiad promotes freedom  obvious everyone choice would give endorsement great pr opportunity location government
people probably decided couldn ' abide hypocrisy figured could catch television
days past  organization play game balance east west cold war
granted olympics lake placid  'd give one location  forth
longer applies
organization award location offended many  especially location decided houseolympic delegationsat tienanmen square  slaughtered democracy activists less number years ago
organization damanged credibility decision
lack enthusiasm games direct result
even chinese want contribute mockery
