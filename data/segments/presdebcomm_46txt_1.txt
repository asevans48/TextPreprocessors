change job  're going covered
lot good things bill done instead trying massive  massive takeover federal government
course democratic congress didn ' want
got republican congress  finally got action  'm proud colleagues republican party getting done

happened one misc  one misc leaders invited go north  felt since whole world community told  something
feel could commit
certainly didn ' feel commit american troops throw gone  way
appropriate thing strategically reduce ability threaten neighbors
expanding 's called no-fly zone increasing allies ' control air space location border suburbs location
right thing
believe
fully effective
make withdraw north
