person person says ' see person spin way team 's admitted lied person person
think way  drag issue deep weeds location 's state legislative history one dogged person critic pursue matter eyes glazed trying keep track various pemutations bill
recap  person initially said voted number bill protecting born-alive aborted fetuses would threatened abortion rights due lack neutrality clause vis-a-vis roe person person
minor problem  bill include clause state sen
person one committee members made sure person voted anyway
meanwhile  bill voted identical bill passed number-number congress claims would voted us senator time
reconcile two positions
simple  since federal abortion laws  federal bill essentially symbolic gesture  whereas course state abortion laws location could affected state bill
say  prepared take stand issue knew stand would practical consequences whatsoever
terrible effect  precisely  state bill would state abortion laws  's clear
's money passage person 's fact sheet  number bill would done something new different existing law notwithstanding neutrality clause would prevented erosion constitutional abortion rights doesn ' say  specifically
read fact sheet 'll see number bill eventually pass ( person left legislature ) apparently included extra clause specifying wouldn ' affect state abortion statutes
person voted number version  lacked second neutrality clause respect state laws
( ) come didn ' push add added first neutrality clause committee meeting  ( organization ) come didn ' mention person person  opting instead claim person incorrectly bill trying undermine roe v wade
adding nuance campaign 's alternative argument  number bill actually wasn ' important already law location doctors try save born-alive fetuses
( see end fact sheet  )
supposed square point radically new different provisions
either bill would done something would done nothing ; team person appears arguing would done
person  according person  's true location law already clearly governed born-alive situations
ag conclude number basis legal action hospital fetuses left die
person says  's precisely location law insufficient time legislature debating new bill begin
eyes glazed yet
's new new spin  's deeply offensive insulting smear father two young children lies infanticide  even though person 're sure lied thus far person
media  shockngly  appears interest story  unless factcheck jumps looks like 'll remain partisan said/he said public safely tune background noise
ah well
update  actually  's fair say 're arguing bill would done something would done nothing
're arguing would done something bad   okay vote secure knowledge location law already provided guidance doctors subject
except  per freddoso 's post ag  didn ' really provide guidance  're awfully coy particulars something bad might
