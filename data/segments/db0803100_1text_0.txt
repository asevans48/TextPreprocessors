long warby digbyi 'm taking lot criticism lately fighting old wars refusing see cusp major change republicans old news
actually fervently hope correct
want know 'm sanguine  think progressives fighting one bloody battle long political war  read person 's post today
day long  response person 's insistence patent illegalities legal  congress basically powerless  administration obligation disclose anything congress ( )  senators would respond impotent comments  `` well  'd like note disagreement ask re-consider `` `` 'm disappointed answer hoping would say something different `` `` 's position  'll discussing another point  ``
supplicants pleading consideration  almost sense mercy  person knew
person go casually tell faces president right violate laws congress power anything
nothing going happen
everyone - - senators  bush officials  country - - knows nothing going happen
nothing extreme person could say senators would prompt consequences greater sighing sorrowful expressions disapproval
democrats may well win election
may large working majority
hopefully get good things done country
run act constitutional abuses  used next time republican office ( sooner ) fight battle  lost tremendous amount territory meantime
lost terms morality decency uncountable
stuff brushed aside
biggest worry neither person  due structural institutional loathing political establishment  person  running uniter fighter little political capital `` looking backwards  `` make priority
's take nothing face value people  harper 's person person  law partner person 's originally endorsed confirmation - - grounds would likely potential nominees exhibit independence ( assessment shared ) - - say watching hearing yesterday  watching person painful experience
