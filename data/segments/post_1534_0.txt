never said anything marriage traditionally equal union
said union man woman part remained constant
like way twisted words order call naive
insinuate heterosexuals consider homosexuals subhumans thus ' want marry
's assumption
're assuming know `` real reason `` heterosexuals ' want allow homosexuals use word marriage
heterosexuals say reason ' want gays marry marriage traditionally union man woman
seem calling heterosexuals liars racists consider gays subhuman
recap  argument based discrediting calling naive appealing reader 's emotions insinuating heterosexuals racists
tend find types arguments weak
mean  name calling trying manipulate people 's emotions instead letting argument stand alone merit weak
understand argument word marriage changed definition time thus 's precedence changing
changes site minor underlying definition [ foundation  ] never changed
always man woman
btw  may want reply
