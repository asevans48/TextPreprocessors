instead got  part  ignorant economic amateur congresscritters combined self-admitted ignorant commentary hosts ( person ) `` journalist panels `` ( worthless worthies infect steph )
person lurked one channel  didn ' spend valuable tv time explaining anything  course
instead heaved struggled present post-partisan-above-the-fray problem fixer available  anyone ask  take country moment 's notice
person person  steph  sounded verge panic ( especially steph lobbed softballs angry tone )  didn ' stop repeating following talking points  spewed shows  mission `` protecting american people  ``
repeated hoary bromide least five times count
( exact line also repeated person person several times another show
nothing simple direct said  least heard  democrat  )
person wants `` clean `` bill
translated  means limits executive compensation  slowing mortgage foreclosures  accountability
'll happy know sinkhole like bush/iraq war  - paulson - going buy bad debt later sold make money
magic trick would accomplished  specifically  much money would made  mentioned
correction - subjects mechanisms money made deliberately  crudely  avoided
person person repeated least three times time rise partisanship
( translated  time try tightly wrap crisis around democrats ' throats blaming current congress  )
wants keep bill congress `` clean simple `` burdened  paraphrase said  pet ideas number congresspeople
