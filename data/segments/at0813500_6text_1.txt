# number true straight ethanol can not pumped thru traditional pipelines currentlytransporting refined gasoline crude various reasons
one reason actual sealsbetween pipeline sections pump re-pump stations along pipelines degradequickly exposed pure ethanol
like today 's modern vehicle vitron rubber seals areimpervious ethanol 's destructive drying nature could pipelines equipped
