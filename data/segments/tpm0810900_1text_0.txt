person person  campaign announces  ``
march numberth  majority democratic voters numberth congressional district location chose support senator hillary clinton vote  `` person said  according camp hillary 's release  ``
representative location 's numberth congressional district  pledging support well  ``
okay - - good time make point
one thing 's polluted whole debate badly constantly shifting definitions people employing `` people  ``
person campaign actually largely consistent point  saying super-dels follow winner national pledged del count
many super-dels decided support based metrics
backed candidate won state

super-dels obviously free employ whichever metric wish
