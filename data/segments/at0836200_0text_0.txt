person person points  nice gesture part person
didn ' since isn ' cinc yet
didn ' make huge production either
reception obama got marines  however  respectful quiet
according organization news  obama entered room absent regular fanfare cheering clapping
diners polite ; staying seated respective tables waited president-elect come stand
person  dressed casually blue polo shirt dark khaki trousers  worked way around room table table took pictures service members
slapped back times  shook hands  signed autographs
hey guys  merry christmas  president-elect said walked table table
apparently  marines middle dinner rise obama moved individual tables
person commends person effort visiting troops suppose merits nod direction nice gesture
think reaction marines significant - smart
reserving judgment person wait see performs first
sounds like good advice us
