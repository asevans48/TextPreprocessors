scoop
claim person fired person person  police chief  refused fire trooper ex-brother-in-law general insubordination  last straw supposedly unauthorized planned trip dc july seek funds anti-rape program
enter person copy person 's travel report proving person 's chief staff  person person  authorized trip late june
smokin ' hole credibility
maybe
people e-mailing say document looks weird  partly person signed line reserved approval trips abroad mainly date next signature june number whereas document dated june number
could signed blank form person 's request  details trip added later
anything 's possible  ( ) doesn ' reflect real well nizich person 're business signing blank forms  especially guy alleged pattern insubordination  ( organization ) occam 's razor suggests nizich probably spaced date wasn ' paying attention line supposed sign
even  document really prove
go back ap 's story earlier week  's abc describes person 's spin  's contradiction
follow timeline  nizich approves trip june number ; palin and/or person get wind shortly thereafter object  leading person 's e-mail july number ; person person plans go  's finally canned four days later
feels like last straw
even person  quoted end abc piece  admits sounds like breakdown communication within person 's staff  nizich page everyone else  sort cover-up
good work  abc
update  abc piece  ie
person 's stated purpose travel report  person attend meeting sen
person  didn ' clue nizich anyone else  precisely  wanted meet person
doesn ' speak well nizich and/or palin 're signing travel vouchers demanding specific reasons trip  especially employee 's supposedly gone renegade  jibe person 's e-mail july number
found going dc  told cancel trip  refused  location
