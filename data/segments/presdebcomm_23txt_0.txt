soviets number things  alliance none
didn ' think 's way deter aggression keep peace
president went  first thing came office make proposal destabilizing weapons  start
strategic weapon person said  well  ' like proposal  said right  'll flexible
urging president went location laid table treaty ban chemical weapons
' want monopoly
said look  let 's come together
come see 're ; 'll go see 're
let 's save kids world chemical weapons
brilliant proposal get rid
soviets nyet  nyet nyet
mutual balance force reduction reduce conventional forces  're even willing tell us base
mrs
person knows  many troops
's four sessions
agreement hot line
carter-monad made agreement  salt ii agreement  democratic senate  democratic administration  democratic senate wouldn ' even ratify agreement
flawed  unverifiable good
president wants reduce  stop  wants reduce dramatically nuclear weapons
soviets know 're going strong president deal  new administration  mr
person  given months office solidify position  'll talk
think opposition  sit  going give mx  give b-l  go freeze locks inferiority europe  things  unilaterally  're willing talk  may sweat four weeks
knows
quarles  quoted saying nuclear war winnable
still belief   circumstances would use nuclear weapons president
bush   ' think 's winnable
quoted wrong  obviously  ' cause never thought
soviet planning  learn director central intelligence  ' think 'd disagreement  based ugly concept
agree president  never fought
nuclear weapons never fought  's approach
therefore  let 's encourage soviets come table gromyko meeting
wish everybody could seen one - president  giving facts gromyko nuclear meetings - excellent  right top subject matter
'll bet gromyko went back location location saying  `` hey  listen  president calling shots ; 'd better move  ``
know think 'll get agreement
think interest location location make  location location
're deterred rhetoric
listened rhetoric two years united nations
've lived communist country
's rhetoric decides agreements  's self-interest countries
quarles  congresswoman person  mr
person verifiable nuclear freeze
democrats said verification may possible
would verify agreement make sure soviets cheating
ferraro  let say first ' think issue important campaign  election  issue war peace
since today person person 's numberth birthday  let quote
said  `` enough want peace  must believe
enough believe  must work  ``
administration 's policies indicated quite opposite
last time heard vice president person blame fact didn ' meet soviet leader  first president forty years meet soviet counterpart
said reason three soviet leaders past three half years
went got computer printout
's five pages leaders  world leaders  soviet leaders met  're little people
're people like mitterrand location person location president person cyprus - go list  five pages people soviet leaders managed meet somehow couldn ' meet president location location
addition meeting soviet counterpart  first president - 're right - since start negotiating arms control agreements negotiated arms control agreement  negotiated one  's opposed every single one every president negotiated  including eisenhower  including ford  including nixon
let say reference vice-president 's comments intent desire united sites administration  location location walk talks
agree
seems number  administration presented start proposal  wasn ' realistic proposal
comment made secretary person left office  dealt dealt land-based nuclear missiles  organization bulk missiles
aside  number  believe  negotiator  nitze  came proposal called `` walk-in-the-woods proposal `` would limited number nuclear arms europe
proposal turned administration - proposal presented administrator
'm delighted met mr
gromyko  could opportunity meet number came organization  done every president  number well
guess - vanocur  congresswoman  'm sorry
speaking limits  impose limit  vice president bush
bush  well  think 's quite difference mr
person location leader free world  person person  terms meeting

mitterrand  mr
person  others met leaders location location
's quite different meeting president location location
soviets say 'll meeting think progress yet left talks
'd like correct opponent walk woods
soviet union unwilling discuss walk woods
ones gunned first record  clear
miss person mentioned inflexibility position strategic arms
yes  offered first get rid - tried reduce ss-number 's weapons
said 's good enough  flexibility  let 's talk bombers planes
's important point terms negotiation
vanocur  congresswoman  taketh away give back
robbed rebuttal
therefore  two minutes rebut
forgive
person  - robbed follow-up  's robbed  ' let give follow-up
vanocur  right  give rebuttal
quarles  congresswoman person  polls show american - americans feel republicans  democrats better able keep location location war
've four years relative peace president person
convince american public world would safer place carter-mondale
[ sic ] person  think first  take look current situation
number nuclear warheads ; building rate five six day us since administration came office
think look 've done recognize 're going much future
since 've done nothing  continue build arms race doesn ' lead anything  leads another arms race 's
vice president person indicated would  first  soon
gets office  contact soviet counterpart set annual summit meeting
's number one
' think start negotiating start talking
